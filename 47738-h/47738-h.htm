    <h2><a id="PREFACE" name="PREFACE">PREFACE.</a></h2>
    <p>Here is offered mere story, the sort of thing Mr.
      Howells cannot tolerate. He will have none of us
      and our works, poor "neo-romanticists" that we are.
      Curiously enough, we neo-romanticists, or most of us,
      will always gratefully have him; of his works we
      cannot have too many; one of us, I know, has walked
      miles to get the magazine containing the latest instalment
      of his latest serial. This looks as if we were
      more liberal than he. He would, for the most part,
      prohibit fiction from being else than the record of
      the passing moment; it should reflect only ourselves
      and our own little tediousnesses; he would hang the
      chamber with mirrors, and taboo all pictures; or
      if he admitted pictures they should depict this hour's
      actualities alone, there should be no figures in costume.</p>
    <p>But who shall decide in these matters what is to
      be and what is not to be? Who shall deny that all
      kinds of fiction have equal right to exist? Who
      shall dictate our choice of theme, or place, or time?
      Who shall forbid us in our faltering way to imagine
      forth the past if we like? The dead past, say you?<span class="pagenum"><a
          id="Page_viii" name="Page_viii">[viii]</a></span>
      As dead as yesterday afternoon, no more. "Where's
      he that died o' Wednesday?" As dead as the
      Queen of Sheba. But on the pages of Sienkiewicz,
      for example, certain little matters of Nero's time
      seem no more dead than last week's divorce trial in
      the columns of those realists, the newspaper reporters.
      All that is not immediately before our eyes,
      whether dead or distant, can be visualised only by
      imagination informed by description, and a small
      transaction in the reign of Elizabeth can be made
      as sensible to the mind's eye as a domestic scene
      between Mr. and Mrs. Jones in the administration of
      McKinley. But how can one describe authentically
      what one can never have seen? You may propound
      that question to the realists; they are often doing it,
      or else they see extraordinary things now and
      then.</p>
    <p>But, now that I remember it, Mr. Howells is not
      really illiberal. He has, upon occasion, admitted a
      tolerance&#8212;nay, an admiration&#8212;for "genuine romance."
      But what is genuine romance? Is psychological
      romance, for instance, more "genuine" than
      melodramatic romance? Are we not all&#8212;we "neo-romanticists"&#8212;aiming
      at genuine romance in some
      kind? Shall there not be many misses to a hit?
      many inconsiderable achievements to a masterpiece?
      And we suffer under limitations which the great
      romancers had not to observe. We must be watch<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_ix"
          name="Page_ix">[ix]</a></span>ful
      against anachronisms, against many liberties in
      style and matter which the esteemed Sir Walter, for
      instance, might take&#8212;and did take&#8212;without stint.
      One's fancy was less restrained, in his day. One
      cannot, as he did, bring Shakespeare to Greenwich
      palace before the festivities at Kenilworth occurred;
      or let a shopman recommend a pair of spectacles to
      a doctor of divinity with the information that the
      king, having tried them on, had pronounced them fit
      for a bishop; or make the divine buy them with the
      cheerful remark that a certain reverend brother's
      advancing age gives hopes of an early promotion.
      Fancy such an exchange of jocularity between a shop
      "assistant" in Piccadilly and Doctor Ingram, while
      the late Doctor Creighton was Bishop of London!
      Flow of fancy is easier upon such terms; or, when
      one may even, as the great Dumas did, be so free of
      care for details as to have the same character in two
      places at the same time.</p>
    <p>It is not meant to be implied that Mr. Howells is
      thought to consider the work of Scott or Dumas
      genuine romance. If he has anywhere mentioned
      an example of what he takes to be true romance, I
      have missed that mention. I should like to read his
      definition (perhaps he has published one which I
      have not seen) of genuine romance. But I would
      rather he taught us by example than by precept.
      What a fine romance he could write if he chose!</p>
    <p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_x" name="Page_x">[x]</a></span></p>
    <p>But as for us less-gifted ones, the "neo-romanticists,"
      shackled as Scott and Dumas were not, we
      must work a while under the new conditions, the
      new checks upon our imagination, ere we shall get
      a masterpiece. Meanwhile none of us yields to Mr.
      Howells in admiration of a true romance, and none
      of us would be sorry to lay down the pen, or shut
      up the typewriter, some fine afternoon and find it
      achieved. But until then may we not have indifferent
      romances, just as we have indifferent realistic
      novels? Why not, pray? Again, shall one man,
      one group, one school, decide what shall be and what
      shall not? "Dost thou think, because thou art
      virtuous, there shall be no more cakes and ale?"</p>
    <p>Now, of merits which mere story may possess, and
      usually does possess in measure greater than the
      other sort of thing does, one is&#8212;construction.
      Wherefore, the opponents of this sort of thing
      belittle that merit. But it is a prime merit, nevertheless.
      Is not the first thing for praise, in a
      picture, its composition? in a building, its main
      design? in a group of statuary, its general effect?
      So, too, in a work of fiction. "Real life does not
      contrive so curiously," says Professor Saintsbury.
      Precisely; if it did, what would be the good of
      fiction? Neither does nature contrive well-ordered
      squares of turf, with walks, flower-beds, hedge-rows,
      shrubbery, trees set with premeditation; shall we, on<span class="pagenum"><a
          id="Page_xi" name="Page_xi">[xi]</a></span>
      that account, make no gardens for ourselves? Who
      shall ordain that there be no well-constructed plots
      in fiction because life, seen in sections as small as
      a novel usually represents, is not well constructed?
      It is time somebody put in a word for plot. When
      all is said and done, the main thing in a story <i>is</i> the
      story.</p>
    <p>Mr. Howells said, long ago, that the stories were
      all told. It is doubtful. But even if it were certain,
      what of it? Because there was an old tale of a
      king's wife whose lover lost the ring she gave him,
      whereupon the king, finding out, bade her wear it on
      a certain soon-coming occasion, and she was put
      to much concern to get it in time, was the world to
      go without the pleasure of D'Artagnan's mission for
      Anne of Austria? And what though Dumas himself
      had used the old situation of a real king imprisoned,
      and his "double" filling the throne in his place,
      were we to have no "Prisoner of Zenda?" Or
      even if the story of the man apparently wooing the
      handsome sister, while really loving the plain sister,
      had already been told, as it had, was Mr. Howells
      prohibited from making it twice told, in "Silas
      Lapham?"</p>
    <p>Now, as to this little attempt at romance in a certain
      kind, I wish merely to say, for the benefit of
      those who turn over the first leaves of a novel in a
      bookstore or library before deciding whether to take<span class="pagenum"><a
          id="Page_xii" name="Page_xii">[xii]</a></span>
      or leave it, that it differs from the usual adventure-story
      in being concerned merely with private life
      and unimportant people. Though it has incidents
      enough, and perils enough, it deals neither with war
      nor with state affairs. It contains no royal person;
      not even a lord&#8212;nor a baronet, indeed, for baronets
      had not yet been invented at the period of the tale.
      The characters are every-day people of the London
      of the time, and the scenes in which they move are
      the street, the tavern, the citizen's house and garden,
      the shop, the river, the public resort,&#8212;such
      places as the ordinary reader would see if a miracle
      turned back time and transported him to London
      in the closing part of Elizabeth's reign. The atmosphere
      of that place and time, as one may find it best
      in the less known and more realistic comedies of
      Shakespeare's contemporaries, in prose narratives
      and anecdotes, and in the records left of actual transactions,
      strikes us of the twentieth century as a
      little strange, somewhat of a world which we can
      hardly take to be real. If I have succeeded in putting
      a breath of this strangeness, this (to us) seeming
      unreality, into this busy tale, and yet have kept the
      tale vital with a human nature the same then as now,
      I have done something not altogether bad. Bad or
      good, I have been a long time about it, for I have
      grown to believe that, though novel-reading properly
      comes under the head of play, novel-writing properly<span class="pagenum"><a
          id="Page_xiii" name="Page_xiii">[xiii]</a></span>
      comes under the head of work. My work herein
      has not gone to attain the preciosity of style which
      distracts attention from the story, or the brilliancy
      of dialogue which&#8212;as the author of "John Inglesant"
      says&#8212;"declares the glory of the author more
      frequently than it increases reality of effect." My
      work has gone, very much, to the avoidance of
      anachronisms. This is a virtue really possessed by
      few novels which deal with the past, as only the
      writers of such novels know. It may be a virtue
      not worth achieving, but it was a whim of mine to
      achieve it. Ill health forbade fast writing, the success
      of my last previous book permitted slow writing,
      and I resolved to utilise the occasion by achieving
      one rare merit which, as it required neither genius
      nor talent, but merely care, was within my powers.
      The result of my care must appear as much in what
      the story omits as in what it contains. The reader
      may be assured at the outset, if it matters a straw to
      him, that the author of this romance of Elizabethan
      London (and its neighbourhood) is himself at home
      in Elizabethan London; if he fails to make the
      reader also a little at home there in the course of
      the story, it is only because he lacks the gift, or
      skill, of imparting.</p>

    <blockquote><p>"Though my hard fate has thrust me out to servitude,<br />
      I tumbled into th' world a gentleman."&#8212;<i>The Changeling.</i></p></blockquote>


    <p>It was long past curfew, yet Captain Ravenshaw
      still tarried in the front room of the Windmill tavern,
      in the Old Jewry. With him were some young
      gentlemen, at whose cost he had been drinking
      throughout the afternoon. For their bounty, he
      had paid with the satirical conversation for which
      he was famed, as well as with richly embellished
      anecdotes of his campaigns. Late in the evening,
      the company had been joined by a young gallant
      who had previously sent them, from another chamber,
      a quantity of Rhenish wine. This newcomer
      now ordered supper for the party, a proceeding at
      which the captain dissembled his long-deferred pleasure&#8212;for
      he had not eaten since the day before.
      Moreover, besides the prospect of supper, there was
      this to hold him at the tavern: he knew not where<span class="pagenum"><a
          id="Page_12" name="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
      he should look for a bed, or shelter, upon leaving it.
      The uncertainty was a grave consideration upon so
      black and windy a night.</p>
    <p>Master Vallance, the gentleman who had ordered
      supper, had listened to the last of Ravenshaw's brag
      with a rather scornful silence. But the other young
      men had been appreciative; it was their pose, or
      affectation, to be as wicked as any man might;
      hence they looked up to this celebrated bully as to
      a person from whom there was much to be learned,
      and in whom there was much to be imitated.</p>
    <p>The group had been sitting before the wide fireplace.
      But as soon as the roast fowls were brought
      in, there was a movement to the long table in the
      middle of the room. The captain was gifted with
      active, striding legs and long, slashing arms. So he
      was first to be seated, and, as he leaned forward
      upon his elbows, he seemed to cover more than his
      share of the table. He had a broad, solid forehead,
      an assertive nose, a narrow but forward chin, gray
      eyes accustomed to flash with a devil-may-care defiance,
      a firm mouth inured to a curve of sardonic
      derision. His rebellious hair, down-turning moustaches,
      and pointed beard were of a dark brown
      hue. He was a man of good height; below the
      sword-belt, he was lank to the ground; above, he
      broadened out well for chest and shoulders. His
      voice was quick, vigorous, and not unpleasantly met<span class="pagenum"><a
          id="Page_13" name="Page_13">[13]</a></span>allic.
      He was under thirty, but rough experience
      had hardened his visage to an older look. His
      jerkin, shirt, hose, shoes, and ruff also betokened
      much and severe usage.</p>
    <p>Master Vallance, in spotless velvet doublet and
      breeches, and perfectly clean silk stockings, looked
      at him with contemptuous dislike.</p>
    <p>"Take heed you scorch not the capon with your
      nose, roaring Ravenshaw," said the youth, quietly.</p>
    <p>It was not Ravenshaw's habit to resent allusions
      to his character as a "roaring boy;" indeed he encouraged
      the popular idea which saddled him with
      that title, at that time applied to bullies of the
      taverns. But some circumstance of the moment,
      perhaps something in the young coxcomb's air of
      aristocratic ridicule, guided the epithet to a sensitive
      spot.</p>
    <p>"<i>Captain</i> Ravenshaw, by your leave," he said,
      instantly, in a loud tone, with an ironical show of
      a petitioner's deference.</p>
    <p>"Forsooth, yes; a captain of the suburbs," replied
      the young gentleman, with a more pronounced sneer.</p>
    <p>Now at this time&#8212;toward the end of the reign
      of Queen Elizabeth&#8212;and for a long time after, certain
      of the suburbs of London were inhabited numerously
      by people of ill repute. There were, especially,
      women whom the law sometimes took in hand and
      sent to the Bridewell to break chalk, or treated to a<span class="pagenum"><a
          id="Page_14" name="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
      public ride in a cart, as targets for rotten vegetables,
      addled eggs, and such projectiles. Many an unemployed
      soldier, or bully who called himself soldier,
      would bestow, or impose, his protection upon some
      one of these frail creatures in the time of her prosperity,
      exacting from her the means of livelihood.
      Hence did Ravenshaw see in the title of "captain
      of the suburbs" an insult little less than lay in that
      of "Apple-John," or "Apple-squire," itself.</p>
    <p>When a gentleman calls another by the name of a
      bad thing, it is not necessarily implied that he thinks
      the other is that thing; but it is certain that he
      means to be defiantly offensive. Therefore, in this
      case, the captain's part was not to deny, but to resent.
      Not only must he keep up his reputation with
      the other gentlemen as a man not to be affronted,
      but he really was in a towering rage at being bearded
      with easy temerity by such a youngling.</p>
    <p>"What!" quoth he. "Thou sprig! Thy wits
      are strayed away, methinks. Or has thy nurse been
      teaching thee to use a pert tongue?"</p>
    <p>"Nay, save your own tongue for the tasting of
      yon capon. I speak only truth. Your reputation
      is well known."</p>
    <p>"Why, thou saucy boy, I may not spit butterflies
      on my sword, nor provoke striplings by giving them
      the lie; else&#8212;"</p>
    <p>The captain finished with a shrug of vexation.</p>
    <p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_15" name="Page_15">[15]</a></span></p>
    <p>"Look ye, gentlemen, he lays it to my youth,"
      continued the persecutor, "but there's yet a horse
      of another colour. This captain is free enough with
      his bluster and his sword; he has drawn quarts of
      blood for a single word that misliked him, upon
      occasion; but he will bear a thousand scurvy affronts
      from any man for the sake of a supper. You
      shall see&#8212;"</p>
    <p>"Supper!" echoed the captain, springing up.
      "Do you cast your filthy supper in my teeth? Nay,
      then, I'll cast it in thine own."</p>
    <p>With this, thoroughly enraged, Captain Ravenshaw
      seized the particular capon to which the gallant
      had alluded, and flung it across the table into the
      gallant's face. It struck with a thud, and, rebounding,
      left the young man a countenance both startled
      and greasy. Not content, the offended captain
      thereupon reached forth to the fowl which had been
      served as companion to the capon, and this he
      hurled in the same direction. But he aimed a little
      too high, moreover the fop ducked his head, and so
      the juicy missile sped across the room, to lodge
      plump against the stomach of a person who had
      just then come into view in the open doorway.</p>
    <p>This person showed lean in body and shabby in
      raiment. He made a swift, instinctive grasp at the
      thing with which he had come so unexpectedly in
      contact, and happened to catch it before it could<span class="pagenum"><a
          id="Page_16" name="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
      fall to the floor. He held it up with both hands
      to his gaze a moment, and then, having ascertained
      beyond doubt its nature, he suddenly turned and
      vanished with it. Let us follow him, leaving behind
      us the scene in the tavern room, which scene, upon
      the landlady's rushing in to preserve order for the
      good name of the house, was very soon after restored
      to a condition of peace by the wrathful departure of
      Ravenshaw from the company of an offender too
      young for him to chastise with the sword.</p>
    <p>The ill-clad person who clutched the cooked fowl,
      which accident had thus summarily bestowed upon
      him, made short work of fleeing down the stairs and
      out into the black, chill February night. Once
      outside, though he could not see his hand before
      his face, he turned toward Cheapside and stumbled
      forward along the miry way, his desire evidently
      being to put himself so far from the Windmill
      tavern that he might not be overtaken by any one
      who could lay claim to the fowl.</p>
    <p>The air was damp as well as cold. The fugitive,
      keeping his ungloved hands warm by spreading them
      around the fowl, which was fresh from the spit, had
      to grope his way through an inky wind. He listened
      for possible footfalls behind him, but he heard none,
      and so he chuckled inwardly and held his prize close
      to his breast with a sense of security. Now and
      then he raised it to his nostrils, in anticipation of<span class="pagenum"><a
          id="Page_17" name="Page_17">[17]</a></span>
      the feast he should enjoy upon arriving at the resting-place
      he had in mind. He would have made a
      strange spectacle to anybody who might have been
      able to see him from one of the rattling casements
      as he passed; but so dark it was that downlookers
      could no more have seen him than he could see
      the painted plaster, carved cross-timbers, projecting
      windows, and gabled roof-peaks of the tall
      houses that lined the narrow street through which
      he fled.</p>
    <p>At one place a lantern hanging over a door threw
      a faint light upon him for a moment, and showed a
      young man's face, with sharp features and a soft
      expression; but the face was instantly gone in the
      darkness, and there was no other night-walker abroad
      in the street to have seen it while it was visible.</p>
    <p>"Surely," he meditated, as he went, "the time of
      miracles has returned. And even a starved scholar
      is found worthy of Heaven's interposition. With the
      temerity of the famished, I enter a tavern, ascend
      the stairs, and steal into a room which I take to be
      empty because no sound comes from it, my only
      hope being to pilfer a little warmth nobody will
      miss, perchance to fall heir to a drop of wine at
      the bottom of a glass, or a bone upon an uncleared
      table. And lo, I find myself in the presence of a
      gentleman asleep before a pot of mulled canary,
      which he has scarce wet his throat withal. In three<span class="pagenum"><a
          id="Page_18" name="Page_18">[18]</a></span>
      swallows I make the canary my own, just in time to
      set down the pot before in comes a tapster. I feign
      I am in search of friends, who must be in t'other
      chamber. To make good the deceit, I must needs
      look in at t'other chamber door; when, behold, some
      follower of Mars, who looks as hungry as myself,
      pelts me with poultry. It is plainly a gift of the
      gods, and I am no such ill-mannered clown as to
      stay and inquire into the matter. Well, <i>gaudeamus
        igitur</i>, my sweet bird; here we are at St. Mary Cole
      Church, on the steps of which we shall make each
      other's better acquaintance. Jove!&#8212;or rather Bacchus!&#8212;what
      tumult a pint or so of mulled wine
      makes in the head of a poor master of arts, when
      too suddenly imbibed!"</p>
    <p>He went half-way up the steps and sat down,
      crouching into the smallest figure possible, as if he
      might thus offer the least surface to the cold. Sinking
      his teeth into the succulent breast of the roast
      fowl, he forgot the weather in the joy of eating.
      But he had scarce taken two bites when he was fain
      to suspend his pleasure, for the sound of rapid footfalls
      came along the way he had just traversed. He
      took alarm.</p>
    <p>"Sit quiet now, in God's name, Master Holyday!"
      he mentally adjured himself. "'Tis mayhap one in
      search of the fowl. Night, I am beholden to thee
      for thy mantle."</p>
    <p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_19" name="Page_19">[19]</a></span></p>
    <p>The person strode past and into Cheapside without
      apprehension of the scholar's presence upon the
      steps. The scholar could not make out the man's
      looks, but could divine from sundry muttered oaths
      he gave vent to, and from his incautious haste of
      movement, that he was angry.</p>
    <p>"God 'a' mercy! how he takes to heart the loss
      of a paltry fowl!" mused Master Holyday, resuming
      the consumption of his supper on the church steps.
      "For, certes, 'twas from the Windmill he came; from
      his voice, and the copiousness of his swearing, I
      should take him to be that very soldier whom the
      gods impelled to provide me with supper. Well, he
      is now out of hearing; and a good thing, too, for
      there comes the moon at last from the ragged edge
      of yon black cloud. Blow, wind, and clear the sky
      for her. Pish! what is this? Can I not find my
      mouth? Ha, ha! 'tis the mulled wine."</p>
    <p>The scholar had indeed struck his nose with the
      fowl, when he had meant to bring it again between
      his teeth. He was conscious of the increased effect
      of the wine in other ways, too, and chiefly in a
      pleasanter perception of everything, a sense of agreeable
      comicality in all his surroundings, a warmed
      regard for all objects within view or thought. This
      enhanced the enjoyment of his meal. The moonlight,
      though frequently dimmed by rushing scraps
      of cloud, made visible the streets near whose junc<span class="pagenum"><a
          id="Page_20" name="Page_20">[20]</a></span>tion
      he sat, so that the house fronts stood strangely
      forth in weird shine and shadow. The scholar,
      shivering upon the steps, was the only living creature
      in the scene. Yet there seemed to be a queer half-life
      come into inanimate things. The wind could be
      heard moaning sometimes in unseen passages. The
      hanging signs creaked as if they now and then
      conversed one with another in brief, monosyllabic
      language.</p>
    <p>"In the daylight," thought the scholar, "men and
      women possess the streets, their customs prevail,
      and their opinions rule. But now, forsooth, the
      house fronts and the signs, the casements and the
      weathercocks, have their conference. Are they considering
      solely of their own matters, or do they tell
      one another tales of the foolish beings that move
      about on legs, hurrying and chattering, by day?
      Faith, is it of me they are talking? See with what
      a blank look those houses gaze down at me, like
      a bench of magistrates at a rogue. But the house
      at the end, the tall one with the straight front,&#8212;I
      swear it is frowning upon me. And the one beside
      it, with the fat oriel windows, and whose upper
      stories belly so far out over the street,&#8212;as I'm a
      gentleman and a scholar, 'tis laughing at me. Has
      it come to this?&#8212;to be a thing of mirth to a monster
      of wood and plaster, a huge face with eyes of glass?
      For this did Ralph Holyday take his degrees at<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_21"
          name="Page_21">[21]</a></span>
      Cambridge University, and was esteemed as able
      a disputant as ever came forth of Benet College?
      Go thy ways, Ralph; better wert thou some fat
      citizen snoring behind yon same walls, than Master
      Holyday, <i>magister artium</i>, lodging houseless on the
      church steps with all thy scholarship. Not so,
      neither; thou wouldst be damned rather! Hark,
      who is it walks in Cheapside, and coming this way,
      too?"</p>
    <p>He might have recognised the tread as the same
      which had some minutes before moved in the opposite
      direction; though it was now less rapid, as if
      the owner of the feet had walked off some of his
      wrath. Coming into view at the end of the Old
      Jewry, that owner proved to be in truth the very
      soldier of whom Holyday had caught a glimpse at
      the tavern. The soldier, turning by some impulse,
      saw the scholar on the steps; but his warlike
      gaze had now no terror for Master Holyday, who
      had put at least half of the fowl beyond possible
      recovery, and whose appetite was no longer keen.</p>
    <p>"God save you, sir!" said the scholar, courteously.
      "Were you seeking a certain roast fowl?"</p>
    <p>"Not I, sirrah," replied Captain Ravenshaw, approaching
      Holyday. "You are he that stood in
      the doorway, perchance? Rest easy; the fowl was
      none of mine. I should scorn to swallow a morsel
      of it."</p>
    <p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_22" name="Page_22">[22]</a></span></p>
    <p>And yet he eyed it in such a manner that Master
      Holyday, who was a good judge of a hungry glance,
      said, placidly:</p>
    <p>"You are welcome to what is left of it here."
      Which offer the scholar enforced with a satisfied
      sigh, indicating fulness of stomach.</p>
    <p>The captain made a very brief pretence of silent
      hesitation, then accepted the remainder of the feast
      from the scholar's hands, saying:</p>
    <p>"Worshipful sir, it should go hard with me ere I
      would refuse true hospitality. Have I not seen you
      about the town before this night?" He sat down
      beside Holyday, and began to devour the already
      much-diminished fowl.</p>
    <p>"I know not," replied the scholar, who had a
      mild, untroubled way of speaking. "'Twas last
      Michaelmas I came to London. I have kept some
      riotous company, but, if I have met you, I remember
      not."</p>
    <p>"'Slight! you know then who I be?"</p>
    <p>"Not I, truly."</p>
    <p>"Yet you call me riotous."</p>
    <p>"That argues no previous knowledge. Though I
      be a Cambridge man, it takes none of my scholarship
      to know a gentleman of brawls at sight, a
      roaring boy, a swaggerer of the taverns&#8212;"</p>
    <p>"Why, boy, why! Do you mean offence in these
      names?"</p>
    <p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_23" name="Page_23">[23]</a></span></p>
    <p>"No offence in the world. You see I bear no
      sword, being but a poor master of arts. None so
      bold of speech as the helpless, among honourable
      men of the sword."</p>
    <p>"Some truth in that. Look ye, young sir, hast
      ever heard of one Ravenshaw, a captain, about the
      town here?"</p>
    <p>"Ay, he is the loudest roarer of them all, I have
      heard; one whose bite is as bad as his bark, too,
      which is not the case with all of these braggadocios;
      but he is a scurvy rascal, is he not? a ragged hector
      of the ale-houses. Is it he you mean?"</p>
    <p>"Ha! that is his reputation? Well, to say truth,
      he may comfort himself by knowing he deserves it.
      But the world used him scurvily first&#8212;nay, a plague
      on them that whine for themselves! I am that
      Ravenshaw."</p>
    <p>"Then I must deal softly; else I am a hare as
      good as torn to pieces by the dogs."</p>
    <p>"Why, no, scholar, thou needst not be afeard. I
      like thee, young night-walker. Thou wert most civil
      concerning this fowl. 'Od's light! but for thee, my
      sudden pride had played my belly a sad trick this
      night. Thou art one to be trusted, I see, and when
      I have finished with this bird, I will tell thee something
      curious of my rascal reputation. But while I
      eat, prithee, who art thou? and what is it hath sent
      thee to be a lodger on the steps of St. Mary Cole<span class="pagenum"><a
          id="Page_24" name="Page_24">[24]</a></span>
      Church? Come, scholar; thou might do worse than
      make a friend of roaring Ravenshaw."</p>
    <p>"Nay, I have no enemies I would wish killed.
      But I am any man's gossip, if he have inclination for
      my discourse, and be not without lining to his headpiece.
      My name is Ralph Holyday; I am only son
      to Mr. Francis Holyday, a Kentish gentleman of
      good estate. He is as different a manner of man
      from me as this night is from a summer day. He
      is stubborn and tempestuous; he will have his way,
      though the house fall for it. He has no love of
      books and learning, neither; but my mother, seeing
      that I was of a bookish mind, worked upon him unceasingly
      to send me to the university, till at last,
      for peace' sake, he packed me off to Cambridge.
      While I was there, my mother died&#8212;rest her soul,
      poor lady! After I took my degrees, my father
      would have it that I come home, and fit myself to
      succeed him. Home I went, perforce, but I had no
      stomach for the life he would lead me. I rather preferred
      to sit among my books, and to royster at the
      ale-house in company with a parson, who had as great
      love for learned disputation as for beer and venison.
      Many a pleasant day and night have I sat with good
      Sir Nicholas, drinking, and arguing upon the soul's
      immortality. This parson had sundry friends, too,
      good knaves, though less given to learning than to
      tossing the pot; they were poachers all, to say truth,<span class="pagenum"><a
          id="Page_25" name="Page_25">[25]</a></span>
      and none better with the crossbow at a likely deer
      than the vicar. Thus, when I ought to have been
      busy in the matter of preserving my father's deer,
      I would be abroad in forbidden quest of other men's;
      'twas, I know not how, the more sportive and curious
      occupation. Well, my father stormed at these ways
      of mine, but there was no method of curing them.
      But one day he became fearful his blood should die
      out. He must have descendants, he swore, and to
      that end I must find a wife straightway. Here is
      where we crossed weapons. I am not blind to the
      charms of women, but I am cursed with such timidity
      of them, such bashfulness when I am near them, that
      if I tried to court one, or if one were put upon me
      as wife, I should fall to pieces for shaking. I would
      sooner attempt anew the labours of Hercules than go
      a-wooing for a wife."</p>
    <p>"'Tis a curious affliction," remarked the captain,
      pausing in his feast. "But many men have it; fighting
      men, too. There was Dick Rokeby, that was
      my comrade in France; he that fought with Harry
      Spence and me, each one 'gainst t'other two, upon
      the question of the properest oath for a soldier to
      swear by. Harry was one of your Latin fellows,
      and held for 'the buckler of Mars.' Dick Rokeby
      said an Englishman could do no better than swear
      by the lance of St. George. And I vowed by the
      spurs of Harry Fift' I would put down any man<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_26"
          name="Page_26">[26]</a></span>
      that thought better of any other oath. We fought
      it out, three-cornered, in Grey's Inn Fields; and the
      spurs of Harry Fift' won the day. As for women,
      I am their enemy on other grounds. There was one
      I trusted, and when I was at the wars she wronged
      me with my friend. I have sworn revenge upon the
      sex, curse 'em! So you would not marry?"</p>
    <p>"That I would not. The only women I can approach
      without trembling at the knees, and my face
      burning, and my tongue sticking fast, are serving-maids
      and common drabs, and such as I would not
      raise to a place of quality. So the end was that,
      after he had raged and threatened for six months,
      my father cast me forth, swearing I should never
      cross his doorsill, or have a penny of him, till I
      should come back with a wife on my arm. And
      so I came last Michaelmas to London."</p>
    <p>"And how hast made shift to live since then?"</p>
    <p>"Why, first upon some money my friend Sir
      Nick thrust upon me; then by the barter of my
      clothes in Cornhill; and meanwhile I had writ a
      play, a tragedy, that Master Henslowe gave me five
      pounds for."</p>
    <p>"I would fain see thy tragedy. How is it
      named?"</p>
    <p>"God knows when it may be played; it has not
      yet been. It is 'The Lamentable Tragedy of Queen
      Nitocris.' The story is in a Greek history."</p>
    <p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_27" name="Page_27">[27]</a></span></p>
    <p>"What, you dare not even discourse with a mere
      gentlewoman, yet write the intimate histories of
      queens?"</p>
    <p>"Yes, friend; there are many of us poor poets do
      so. We herd with trulls, and dream of empresses.
      (A passable decasyllabic line, that!) But I have not
      been able to sell another tragedy, nor yet to have
      my sonnets printed, whereby I might get ten pounds
      for a dedication. And so you see me as I am."</p>
    <p>"Well," said the captain, having by this time
      pretty well stuffed himself, "I like thee the better
      for being a poet. Such as you know me to
      be, you will scarce believe it; but I am one&#8212;or
      was once&#8212;fitted by nature to take joy in naught
      so much as in poetry, and the sweet pastoral life
      that poets praise so. But never whisper this; I
      were a dead man if the town knew the softness
      underneath my leathern outside. But in very truth,
      as for books, I would give all the Plutarchs in the
      world for one canto of 'The Faerie Queene' or ten
      pages of the gentler part of Sidney's 'Arcadia.'
      Had I won my choice, I had passed my days, not
      in camps and battles, taverns and brawls, but in
      green meadows, sitting and strolling among flowers,
      reading some book of faery or shepherds&#8212;for I
      never could make up poetry of my own."</p>
    <p>"That picture belies the common report of
      Captain Ravenshaw."</p>
    <p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_28" name="Page_28">[28]</a></span></p>
    <p>"Ay, Master Holyday; swaggering Ravenshaw is
      no shepherd of poesy. But hearken to what I promised
      thee: I, too, am a gentleman's son; the family is
      an old one in Worcestershire,&#8212;observe I call it not
      <i>my</i> family. I was early a cast-off scion, and for no
      fault of mine, I swear. 'Twas the work of a woman,
      a she-devil, that bewitched my father. But God
      forbid I should afflict any man, or rouse mine own
      dead feelings, with the tale of my wrongs! I was
      no roaring boy then; I was a tame youth, and a
      modest. But when I found myself out in the world,
      I soon learned that with a mild mien, unless a man
      have a craftiness I lacked, he is ever thrust backward,
      and crushed against the wall, or trodden upon
      in the ditch. And so for policy I took the time and
      pains to make myself a master of the sword, not
      that I might brawl, but that I might go my ways in
      peace. In good time, I killed two men or so that
      were thought invincible; and I supposed the noise
      of this would save me from affronts after that."</p>
    <p>"And was it not so?"</p>
    <p>"Perchance it had been, if my manner had comported
      with the deed. But I still went modest in
      my bearing, and so my prowess was soon forgot;
      some may have thought my victories an accident of
      fortune; besides, strangers knew not what I had done,
      and saw no daring in me; and so I found myself as
      unconsidered as ever. And at last, when the woman<span class="pagenum"><a
          id="Page_29" name="Page_29">[29]</a></span>
      I loved turned treacherous and robbed me of the
      friend at court on whom my fortune hung, and
      malice was hatched in me, I bethought me of a
      new trick. I took on a bold front, an insolent
      outside; I became a swearer, a swaggerer, a roaring
      boy, a braggart; and lo! people soon stepped aside
      to let me pass. I found this blustering masquerade
      a thousand times more potent to secure immunity
      than my real swordsmanship had been. The transformation
      was but skin-deep at first; but the wars,
      and my hard life and my poverty, helped its increase,
      so that now it has worked in to the heart of me.
      There was a time it made me ill to sink my rapier
      into a man's soft flesh, but I grew to be of stronger
      stomach. And when I first put on the mask of
      brazen effrontery, I was often faint within when I
      seemed most insolent. But now I am indeed roaring
      Ravenshaw, all but a little of me, and that little often
      sleeps."</p>
    <p>"But this insolence of thine, real or false, seems
      not to have made thy fortune."</p>
    <p>"Nay, but it has made my poverty the less contemptible.
      Lay not my undoing to it. When the
      war lasted, I fared well enough, as long as I kept
      the captainship my friend had got me ere the woman
      played me false. A score of things have happened
      to bring me to this pass. My braggadocio, ofttimes
      enforced with deeds, hath neither helped nor hin<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_30"
          name="Page_30">[30]</a></span>dered
      my downfall; it hath stood me in good stead
      in fair times and foul. Pish, man, but for my reputation,
      and the fear of my enmity or violence, could
      I have run up such scores at taverns as I have done,
      being penniless? How often have I roared dicing
      fools, and card-playing asses, out of the stakes when
      they had fairly won 'em? Could any but a man who
      has made himself feared do such things, and keep
      out of Newgate or at least the Counter i' the Poultry
      here?"</p>
    <p>"Why, is not that rank robbery, sir?"</p>
    <p>"Yes, sir, and rank filling of my empty stomach.
      Tut, scholar, you have been hungry yourself; roofless,
      too. Be so as oft as I have been, and with as
      small chance of mending matters, and I'll give a
      cracked three farthings for what virtue is left in you.
      Boy, boy, hast thou yet to learn what a troublesome
      comrade thy belly is, in time of poverty? What a
      leader into temptation? Am I, who was once a gentleman,
      a rascal as well as a brawler? Yes, I am a
      rascal. So be it; and the more beholden I to my
      rascality when it find me a dinner, or a warm place
      to sleep o' nights. Would it might serve us now.
      Who are these a-coming?"</p>
    <p>Some dark figures were approaching from up the
      Old Jewry, attended by two fellows bearing links, for
      the moonlight was not to be relied upon. The figures
      came arm in arm, at a blithe but unsteady gait, sway<span class="pagenum"><a
          id="Page_31" name="Page_31">[31]</a></span>ing
      and plunging. Presently the captain recognised
      the gentlemen who had been his afternoon companions
      at the sign of the Windmill. But Master Vallance
      was not with them, having doubtless taken
      lodging at one of the inns near the tavern. The
      sparks, jubilant with their wine, no sooner made out
      the captain's form than they hailed him heartily.</p>
    <p>"What, old war boy!" cried Master Maylands, a
      spruce and bold young exquisite. "Well met, well
      met! Hey, gentles, we'll make a night on't. Captain,
      you shall captain us, captain!"</p>
    <p>"Ay, you shall captain us about the town," put in
      Master Hawes, who spoke shrilly, and with a lisp,
      for which he would have been admired had it been
      affected, but for which he was often ridiculed because
      it was natural. "You shall teach us to roar as loud
      as you do. What say you, gallants? Shall we go to
      school to him to learn roaring? He is the master
      swaggerer of all that ever swaggered."</p>
    <p>The proposal was received with noisy approval, the
      roysterers gathering around the captain where he
      sat, and grasping him by the sleeves to draw him
      along with them.</p>
    <p>"Softly, gentlemen, softly," said the captain. "Ye
      seem of a mind here. But do you consider? There
      is much I might impart, in the practice of swaggering.
      Would you in good sooth have me for a
      tutor?"</p>
    <p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_32" name="Page_32">[32]</a></span></p>
    <p>There was a chorus of affirmative protestation.</p>
    <p>The captain thought it politic to urge a scruple.</p>
    <p>"But bethink ye," quoth he, "to be a true swaggerer
      is no child's play. And you are of delicate
      rearing, all; meant to play lutes in ladies' chambers;
      court buds, gallants."</p>
    <p>"Why, then," said Maylands, "we shall be gallants
      and swaggerers, too; an you make swaggerers of us,
      we will make a gallant of you, will we not, boys?"</p>
    <p>"Nay," replied Ravenshaw, "I have been a gallant
      in my time, and need but the clothes to be one again;
      and so does my friend here, who is a gentleman and
      a scholar, though out of favour with fortune. Now
      there be many tricks in the swaggering trade; the
      choice of oaths is alone a subtle study, and that is
      but one branch of many. I'll not be any man's
      schoolmaster for nothing."</p>
    <p>"Faith, man, who asks it?" cried Master Maylands.
      "We'll pay you. For an earnest, take my
      cloak; my doublet is thick." He flung the rich
      broadcloth garment over the captain's uncloaked
      shoulders. "You need but the clothes to be a gallant
      again? 'Fore God, I believe it! Tom Hawes,
      I've cloaked him; you doublet him. Barter your
      doublet for his jerkin; your cloak will hide it for the
      night; you've a score of doublets at home."</p>
    <p>Master Maylands, in his zeal, fell upon the unobjecting
      Hawes, and in a trice had helped to effect the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_33"
          name="Page_33">[33]</a></span>
      transfer, the captain feigning a helpless compliance
      in the hands of his insistent benefactors. It occurred
      to another of the youths, Master Clarington, to exchange
      his jewelled German cap of velvet for Ravenshaw's
      ragged felt hat; whereupon Master Dauncey,
      not to be outdone, would have had his breeches
      untrussed by his link-boy, to bestow upon the captain,
      but that the captain himself interposed on the
      score of the cold weather.</p>
    <p>"But I'll take it as kindly of you," said Ravenshaw,
      "if you should have a cloak for my scholar
      friend. How say you, Master Holyday? Thou'lt
      be one of us? Thou'lt be a swaggering gallant,
      too?"</p>
    <p>Master Holyday, inwardly thanking his stars for
      the benevolent impulse which had made him share
      the fowl, and so elicit this gratitude, would have
      agreed to anything under the moon (except to woo
      a woman) for the sake of warmer clothes.</p>
    <p>"Yes, sir," said he, with his wonted studious gravity
      of manner; "if these gentlemen will be so gracious."</p>
    <p>The gentlemen were readily so gracious. After
      a few rapid exchanges, which they treated as a great
      piece of mirth, they beheld the scholar also cloaked
      and richly doubleted and hatted. He wore his fine
      garments with a greater sense of their comfort than
      of his improved appearance, yet with a somewhat
      pleasant scholastic grace.</p>
    <p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_34" name="Page_34">[34]</a></span></p>
    <p>The captain strutted a little way down the street,
      to enjoy the effect of his new cloak; but, as he
      stepped into Cheapside, the moon was clouded, and
      he could no longer see the garment tailing out finely
      over his sword behind. A distant sound of plodding
      feet made him look westward in Cheapside, and he
      saw a few dim lanterns approaching from afar.</p>
    <p>"Lads, the watch is coming," said he. "Shall we
      tarry here, and be challenged for night-walkers?"</p>
    <p>"Marry," quoth Master Maylands, leaping forward
      to the captain's side, "we shall take our first lesson
      in swaggering now; we shall beat the watch."</p>
    <p>"As good a piece of swaggering gallantry as any,"
      said the captain. "Come, my hearts!"</p>
    <p>And he led the way along Cheapside toward the
      approaching watchmen.</p>
    <hr class="chap" />
    <p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_35" name="Page_35">[35]</a></span></p>
    <h2><a id="CHAPTER_II" name="CHAPTER_II">CHAPTER II.</a></h2>
    <div class="center">DISTURBERS OF THE NIGHT.</div>

      <blockquote><p>"I will have the wench."<br />
      "If you can get her."&#8212;<i>The Coxcomb.</i></p></blockquote>

    <p>The captain gave instructions, as he and his pupils
      strode forward. The two boys with the lights were
      left behind to take shelter in a porch, so that the
      peace-breakers might advance in the greater darkness.
      It was enough for their purpose that they
      had the lanterns of the watch to guide them.</p>
    <p>The watchmen came trudging on in ranks of two.
      Presently there could be heard, from somewhere
      among them, a voice of lamentation, protest, and
      pleading, with a sound of one stumbling against
      sundry ill-set paving-stones of the street.</p>
    <p>"They have a prisoner," said the captain to his
      followers. "We'll make a rescue of this. Remember,
      lads, no swords to be used on these dotards;
      but do as I've told ye."</p>
    <p>In another moment, and just when the watchmen
      seemed about to halt for consideration, but before
      their leader had made up his mind to cry, "Stand!"
      the captain shouted, "Now, boys, now; a rescue!<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_36"
          name="Page_36">[36]</a></span>
      a rescue!" and the roysterers rushed forward with a
      chorus of whoops.</p>
    <p>The watch, composed for the most part of old
      men, had scarce time to huddle into a compact form
      when the gallants were upon them. The assailants,
      keeping up their shouting, made to seize the watchmen's
      bills, with which to belabour them about their
      heads and shoulders. One or two were successful
      in this; but others found their intended victims
      too quick, and were themselves the recipients
      of blows. These unfortunate ones, bearing in mind
      the captain's directions, essayed to snatch away lanterns,
      and to retaliate upon the watchmen's skulls;
      and whoever failed in this, rushed to close quarters,
      grasped an opponent's beard, and hung on with all
      weight and strength.</p>
    <p>The captain's operations were directed against the
      pair who had immediate charge of the prisoner. Possessing
      himself of the bill of one, whom, by the same
      act, he caused to lose balance and topple over, he
      obtained the other's voluntary retreat by a gentle
      poke in the paunch. The prisoner himself proved
      to be a man of years, and of port; he had a fat,
      innocent face, and he showed, by his dress and every
      other sign that became visible when the captain held
      up a lantern before him, to be a gentleman. What
      such a guileless, well-fed old person could have done
      to fall afoul of the night-watch, Captain Ravenshaw<span class="pagenum"><a
          id="Page_37" name="Page_37">[37]</a></span>
      could not imagine. For the time, the old person's
      astonishment and relief at being set free were too
      great to permit his speaking.</p>
    <p>Meanwhile, Master Holyday, having been the last
      to come up, found the melée so suddenly precipitated,
      and so complete without his intrusion, that he stood
      back looking for a convenient place and time for him
      to plunge into it. But it seemed impossible for him
      to penetrate the edge of the scuffle, or to connect
      himself with it in any effective way. So he hung
      upon the skirts; until at last two of the watchmen,
      being simultaneously minded for flight, bore down
      upon him from out of the hurly-burly. He instinctively
      threw out his arms to stay their going; whereupon
      he found himself grappled with on either side,
      and from that instant he had so much to do himself
      that he lost all observation of the main conflict. Nor
      had the other fighters any knowledge of this side
      matter. But their own sport was over ere their wind
      was out; the watchmen, being mainly of shorter
      breath and greater prudence than their antagonists,
      soon followed the example of flight; and the gallants,
      soberer by sundry aches, smarts, and bruises, were left
      masters of the field. None of the watch was too much
      battered to be able to scamper off toward the Poultry.</p>
    <p>"A piece of good luck, sir," began Captain Ravenshaw,
      to the released prisoner, around whom the
      gallants assembled while they compared knocks and<span class="pagenum"><a
          id="Page_38" name="Page_38">[38]</a></span>
      trophies. "You had been scurvily lodged this night,
      else."</p>
    <p>"Sirs, I thank ye," replied the old gentleman, finding
      at last his voice, though it was the mildest of
      voices at best. He was still shaky from having been
      so recently in great fright; but he gathered force as
      his gratitude grew with his clearer sense of escape.</p>
    <p>"God wot, I am much beholden to ye. You know
      not what you have saved me from."</p>
    <p>"To say truth, a lousy hole behind an iron grating were
      no pleasant place for one of your quality,"
      said Ravenshaw.</p>
    <p>"Oh, 'tis not that so much, though 'twere bad
      enough," said the gentleman, with a shudder. "'Tis
      the lifetime of blame that would have followed when
      my wife had heard of it. You must know, sirs, I am
      a country gentleman, and I am not known to be in
      London; my detention would be noised about, and
      when it reached my wife's ears&#8212;'sfoot, sirs, I am
      for ever your debtor in thankfulness!" And he
      looked his meaning most fervently.</p>
    <p>"Why did the watch take you up?" inquired the
      captain.</p>
    <p>"Why, for nothing but being abroad in the streets.
      The plaguey rascals said I was a night-walker, and
      that I behaved suspiciously. I did nothing but stand
      and wait at the Standard yonder, for one I had agreed
      to meet; but when I saw the watch coming I stepped<span class="pagenum"><a
          id="Page_39" name="Page_39">[39]</a></span>
      back, to be out of their lantern-light. This stepping
      back, they said, proved I was a rogue; and so they
      clapped hands on me, and fetched me along. But
      now I bethink me, sirs: the person I was to meet&#8212;what
      will she do an she find me not at the place?"
      The old gentleman showed a reawakened distress,
      and, turning toward the direction whence the watch
      had brought him, looked wistfully and yet reluctantly
      into the darkness.</p>
    <p>"Oho! She!" quoth the captain. "No wonder
      your wife&#8212;"</p>
    <p>"Nay, think no harm, I beg. Nay, nay, good sirs!
      Sure, 'tis an evil-thinking world. Well, I must e'en
      bid ye good night, and leave ye my best thanks.
      Would I might some day repay you this courtesy.
      My name, sirs&#8212;but no, an ye'll pardon me, I durst
      not; the very stones might hear it, and report I was
      in London. But if I might know&#8212;"</p>
    <p>"Surely. We have no wives in the country, that
      we must keep our doings from, have we, boys? And
      we are free of the streets of London, aren't we, boys?
      My name, sir, is Ravenshaw&#8212;Captain Ravenshaw;
      and this gentleman&#8212;"</p>
    <p>He was about to introduce his companions by the
      names of great persons of the court, when, casting
      his eyes over the group for the first time since the
      link-boys had come up with their torches, he was
      suddenly otherwise concerned.</p>
    <p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_40" name="Page_40">[40]</a></span></p>
    <p>"Why, where's Master Holyday? Where the
      devil's our scholar?"</p>
    <p>The gallants looked from one to another, and then
      peered into the surrounding darkness, but saw no
      one; nor came any answer to the captain's shout,
      "What ho, Holyday! Hollo, hollo!"</p>
    <p>"An't please you," spoke up one of the link-boys,
      "while we waited yonder, the watchmen ran past us;
      and methought two of them dragged a man along
      between them; but 'twas so dark, and they went
      so fast&#8212;"</p>
    <p>"Marry, that's how the wind lies," cried the
      captain. "Gallants, here's more business of a
      roaring nature. A rescue! Come, the hunt is up!
      To the cage, boys! We may catch 'em on the way."</p>
    <p>Without more ado, Ravenshaw led his followers,
      link-boys and all, on a run toward the Poultry, leaving
      the grateful old gentleman in the darkness and
      to his own devices.</p>
    <p>They hastened to the night-watch prison, but overtook
      no one on the way; it was clear that the watchmen
      had made themselves and their prisoner safe
      behind doors. An attack on the prison would have
      been a more serious business than the captain could
      see any profit in. So, abandoning the luckless
      scholar to the course of the law, the night-disturbers
      made their way back to Cheapside, wondering what
      riotous business they might be about next.</p>
    <p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_41" name="Page_41">[41]</a></span></p>
    <p>"What asses are these!" thought the captain.
      "They have warm beds to go to, yet they rather wear
      out their soles upon the streets in search of trouble.
      Well, it helps me pass the night, and I am every way
      the gainer by it; so if puppies must needs learn to
      play the lion, may they have no worse teacher."</p>
    <p>When they came to the Standard, that ancient
      stone structure rising in the middle of the street,
      they walked around it to see if the old gentleman
      was there; but the place was deserted.</p>
    <p>"Here were a matter to wager upon, now," observed
      the captain: "Whether he met his mistress
      after all and bore her away, or whether he found
      her not and went wisely to bed."</p>
    <p>A few steps farther brought the strollers opposite
      the mouth of Bread Street. The sound of men's
      voices came from within this narrow thoroughfare.</p>
    <p>"Marry, here be other fellows abroad," quoth the
      captain. "How if we should 'light upon occasion for
      a brawl? Then we should see if we could put them
      down with big words. Come, lads."</p>
    <p>They turned into the narrow street and proceeded
      toward a group whose four or five dark figures were
      indistinctly marked in the flickering glare of a single
      torch. This group appeared to be circled about a
      closed doorway opposite All-hallows Church, at the
      farther corner of Watling Street, in which doorway
      stood the object of its attention.</p>
    <p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_42" name="Page_42">[42]</a></span></p>
    <p>"Some drunken drab o' the streets, belike," said
      the captain, in a low voice, to his followers. "We'll
      feign to know her, and we'll call ourselves her
      friends; that will put us on brawling terms with
      those gentlemen. They are gallants, sure, by their
      cloaks and feathers."</p>
    <p>The gentlemen were, it seemed, too disdainful of
      harm to interrupt their mirth by looking to see who
      came toward them. The heartless amusement on
      their faces, the tormenting tone of the jesting words
      they spoke, gave an impression somewhat like that of
      a pack of dogs surrounding a helpless animal which
      they dare not attack, but which they entertain themselves
      by teasing.</p>
    <p>The captain stepped unchallenged into the little
      circle, and looked at the person shrinking in the
      doorway, who was quite visible in the torchlight.</p>
    <p>"'Slight!" quoth the captain. "This is no trull;
      'tis a young gentlewoman."</p>
    <p>His surprise was so great as to make him for the
      moment forget the plan he had formed of precipitating
      a quarrel. The young gentlewoman looked very
      young indeed, and very gentle, being of a slight figure,
      and having a delicate face. She leaned close
      against the door, at which she had, as it seemed, put
      herself at bay. Her face, still wet with tears, retained
      something of the distortion of weeping, but
      was nevertheless charming. Her eyes, yet moist,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_43"
          name="Page_43">[43]</a></span>
      were like violets on which rain had fallen. Her lips
      had not ceased to quiver with the emotion which had
      started her tears. Her hair, which was of a light
      brown, was in some disorder, partly from the wind;
      for the hood of the brown cloak she wore had been
      pulled back. It might easily be guessed who had
      pulled it, for the gentleman who stood nearest her,
      clad in velvet, and by whose behaviour the others
      seemed to be guided, held in his hand a little black
      mask, which he must have plucked from the girl's
      face.</p>
    <p>This gentleman was tall, nobly formed, and of a
      magnificent appearance. His features were ruddy,
      bold, and cut in straight lines. He wore silken black
      moustaches, and a small black beard trimmed to two
      points.</p>
    <p>At the captain's words, this gentleman looked
      around, took full note of the speaker in a brief
      glance, and scarce dropping his smile,&#8212;a smile careless
      and serene, of heartless humour,&#8212;said, calmly:</p>
    <p>"Stand back, knave; she is not for your eyes."</p>
    <p>The captain had already thought of the inequality
      between this fragile damsel and her persecutors;
      despite his account against womankind, her looks
      and attitude had struck within him a note of compassion;
      and now her chief tormentor had called
      him a knave. He remembered the purpose with
      which he had arrived upon the scene.</p>
    <p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_44" name="Page_44">[44]</a></span></p>
    <p>"Knave in your teeth, thou villain, thou grinning
      Lucifer, thou&#8212;thou&#8212;!" The captain was at a
      loss for some word of revilement that might be used
      against so fine a gentleman without seeming ridiculously
      misapplied. "Thou beater of the streets for
      stray fawns, thou frighter of delicate wenches!"</p>
    <p>"Why, what motley is this?" replied the velvet
      gallant. "What mummer that is whole-clad above
      the girdle, and rags below? what mongrel, what
      patch, what filthy beggar in a stolen cloak? Avaunt,
      thing!"</p>
    <p>The gentleman grasped the gilded hilt of his
      rapier, as if to enforce his command if need be.</p>
    <p>"Ay, draw, and come on!" roared the captain.
      "You'll find me your teacher in that."</p>
    <p>At the same moment a restraining clutch was put
      upon the gentleman's sleeve by one of his companions,
      who now muttered some quick words of prudence
      in his ear. Whether it was due to this, or to
      the captain's excellent flourish in unsheathing, he
      of the double-pointed beard paused in the very movement
      of drawing his weapon, and a moment later
      slid the steel back into its velvet scabbard. In his
      desistance from a violent course, there was evidently
      some consideration private to himself and his friend,
      some secret motive for the avoidance of a brawl.</p>
    <p>"Say you so?" quoth the gentleman, blandly, as
      if no untoward words had passed. "Well, if you<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_45"
          name="Page_45">[45]</a></span>
      can be my teacher, you must be as good a rapier-and-dagger
      man as any in the kingdom, and there's an
      end on't. Are you that?"</p>
    <p>"Sir, you might have tried me, and found out,"
      said the captain, considerably mollified at the other's
      unexpected politeness, and putting up his sword.</p>
    <p>"Why, marry, another time I may have occasion
      to see your skill&#8212;nay, I mean not a challenge; I
      should enjoy to see you fight any man."</p>
    <p>"But what of this gentlewoman, sir?" said the
      captain, interrogatively.</p>
    <p>"Why, you will not dispute, it is my prize, by
      right of discovery. You a swordman, and not know
      the laws of war? Faith, we men of the sea are better
      learned."</p>
    <p>"Nay, but is she of the breed to make a prize of?
      Methinks she looks it not."</p>
    <p>"Pish, man, a pretty thing or so; a citizen's filly,
      mayhap, that hath early slipped the halter; she will
      not tell her name; but what we find loose in the
      streets after curfew, we know what it is, whatsoever
      it may look."</p>
    <p>The girl now spoke for the first time since the
      captain had seen her. Her voice, though disturbed
      by her feelings, was not shrill like a child's, but
      had the fulness of blossoming womanhood, and
      went with the smoothness common to well-bred
      voices.</p>
    <p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_46" name="Page_46">[46]</a></span></p>
    <p>"I was never in the streets at night before," she
      said, sobbingly. "There was one I was to meet, who
      was waiting for me at the Standard in Cheapside."</p>
    <p>"Eh!" quoth the captain, with a suddenly increased
      interest.</p>
    <p>"Some gallant 'prentice, belike," said the gentleman
      in velvet, with his singular smile of gaiety and
      cruelty. "Some brave cavalier of the flat cap, whom
      we frighted off."</p>
    <p>"'Twas not so!" cried the girl. "He was not
      frighted off. I was going to him, and was near the
      place, but I could not see him yet, 'twas so dark.
      And then the watch came, with their lanterns, and I
      stood still, so they might not observe me. But I saw
      them go to the Standard, and take my&#8212;my friend
      that waited for me. I knew not what to do, and so
      I stayed where I was, all dismayed. And then, but
      not till the watch had gone away with him, came
      you cruel gentlemen and found me. So he was not
      frighted by you. Alas, if he had but seen me, and
      come to meet me!"</p>
    <p>"But he was soon free of the watch," said the
      captain, wondering what such a damsel should have
      to do in surreptitiously meeting such a worshipful
      old married gentleman. "Came he not back to the
      place? 'Tis a good while since."</p>
    <p>"How know you about him?" queried the girl,
      with wonder.</p>
    <p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_47" name="Page_47">[47]</a></span></p>
    <p>"'Tis no matter," said the captain, forgetting for
      the nonce to brag of an exploit. "He ought to have
      come back to the place to seek you; he was no true
      man, else."</p>
    <p>"Belike he did, then," said the girl, quickly, with
      hope suddenly revived.</p>
    <p>"Nay, 'tis certain he waits not at the Standard;
      we came from there but now. Doubtless his taking
      up by the watch gave him his fill of waiting there.
      He seemed a man with no stomach for night
      risks."</p>
    <p>"Then," said the girl, mournfully, "he must have
      come back after I had run from these gentlemen.
      Then he would think I could not meet him; 'twas
      past the time we had set. Oh, villains, that I should
      run from you, and miss my friend, and yet be caught
      at last! He would give all up, and go to his inn,
      and back to the country at daybreak. All's over
      with me! Oh, ye have much to answer for!"</p>
    <p>"How prettily it cries!" quoth the handsome
      gentleman.</p>
    <p>"Faith, sir," said the captain, good-humouredly,
      "let's see an 'twill laugh as prettily. How if we led
      this dainty weeper to her friend's inn, and roused
      him out? Perchance then we shall have smiles for
      these showers. Where does he lie, little mistress?"</p>
    <p>"Alas, I know not. 'Twould be near the river,
      I think."</p>
    <p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_48" name="Page_48">[48]</a></span></p>
    <p>"Oho, that he might take boat quicker," said the
      gentleman. "And now will he fly without thee at
      daybreak, say'st thou? Never sorrow, sweetheart;
      I'll boat thee to Brentford myself to-morrow."</p>
    <p>"There be scores of inns near the river," said the
      captain to the girl. "But we might make trial at
      some of them, an we knew by what name to call for
      your friend."</p>
    <p>"Nay, that I'll never tell! I know not if he
      would give his true name at the inn. Alas, what
      shall I do?"</p>
    <p>"Why, come to the tavern and make merry," said
      Velvet Suit, "as we have been inviting you this
      half-hour."</p>
    <p>"I'll freeze in the streets sooner!"</p>
    <p>"Is there need of that, then?" asked the captain.
      "Hast no place in London to go to? Came you not
      from some place to meet your friend?"</p>
    <p>"From my father's house, of course."</p>
    <p>"Then why not go back to it? What's to fear?
      'Twas late when you came forth, was it not? I'll
      wager thy people were abed. Did they know you
      meant to play the runaway?"</p>
    <p>"'Tis not like they know it yet," she replied, a
      little relieved from complete dismay, but still downhearted.</p>
    <p>"And sure the way you came by must be open
      still," went on the captain.</p>
    <p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_49" name="Page_49">[49]</a></span></p>
    <p>"I locked the door behind me; but I left the key
      where I can find it, if you gentlemen will let me go.
      You will, sirs; I'll thank ye so much! I am undone
      every way, else."</p>
    <p>"Of course we'll let you go," said the captain,
      decisively, with an oblique eye upon the velvet gallant.
      "We'll be thy body-guard, forsooth; we'll
      attend thee to thy door."</p>
    <p>"Nay, let me go alone, I beg!"</p>
    <p>"Why, would you risk more dangers?"</p>
    <p>"I have not far to go. Pray, pray, follow me not!
      Pray, let me be unknown to ye, good sirs! Think,
      if my mishap this night were noised about, and
      my name known&#8212;think, if my father were to
      hear it!"</p>
    <p>"Ay, true," said the captain. "Go alone, but on
      condition, if you see harm ahead, you turn back to
      us; you must cry for help, too. And so we give
      our words of honour not to&#8212;"</p>
    <p>"Softly, softly, Master Meddler," broke in the
      handsome gentleman. "Be not so free with your
      betters' words of honour. I know not what hath
      allowed you to live so long after thrusting in upon
      this company&#8212;"</p>
    <p>But again he was checked by the man at his elbow.
      This was a broad-breasted man of medium height,
      who seemed, as well as his plain dark cloak would
      show, to be of solid, heavy build; as for his face, its<span class="pagenum"><a
          id="Page_50" name="Page_50">[50]</a></span>
      lower part was so covered by a thick, spade-shaped
      beard, and the upper part so concealed by the brim
      of a great Spanish hat, purposely pulled down over
      the eyes, that one could not have obtained a sufficient
      glimpse for future recognition. He spoke to his gay
      companion in a brief whisper, but his words had
      instant weight.</p>
    <p>"Tush! 'tis not worth bloodshed," said the gay
      gentleman, having heard him. "Let the wench go;
      what is one fawn among so many? But on condition.
      I crave more of your acquaintance, Sir Swordman;
      we may come to a fight yet, with better
      reason; so my friends and I will let the girl go hang,
      an you and your party come drink with us."</p>
    <p>"We are your men there," replied the captain,
      warming up within, at such a happy issue; "but the
      taverns are barricaded at this hour."</p>
    <p>"I know where the proper knock will open doors
      to us. 'Tis agreed, then. Wench, go your ways;
      good night!"</p>
    <p>He moved aside to let her pass, and the girl,
      stepping from the doorway, with a single look of
      thanks to the captain, ran swiftly toward Cheapside.
      She was out of the range of the torchlight in a
      moment. As soon as her figure was invisible in the
      night, the gentleman in velvet left his companion,
      and, taking the captain fraternally by the arm, started
      toward Knightrider Street.</p>
    <p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_51" name="Page_51">[51]</a></span></p>
    <p>Ravenshaw, yielding in spite of an inclination to
      stay and listen for any distant sign of alarm from
      the girl, strode mechanically along; he heard his
      own followers and the gentleman's friends coming
      close behind, and starting up conversations. Lighted
      by the two link-boys and the other torch-bearer, the
      party at length stopped before a tavern door in
      Thames Street.</p>
    <p>The handsome gallant knocked a certain number
      of times, and, while he waited for answer, the party
      huddled into a close group before the door. Every
      face was now in the torchlight, and the captain cast
      a glance over the little company. Suddenly a strange
      look came into his face.</p>
    <p>"What's this?" he said to the gentleman, quickly.
      "Where's your other friend&#8212;he with the hat pulled
      over his eyes?"</p>
    <p>For answer, the gentleman gave a curious smile,
      showing white teeth; and his eyes sparkled mockingly.</p>
    <p>"Death and hell! Gods and devils!" cried the
      captain, roaring in earnest, and whipping out his
      sword. "He slunk back and followed the maid,
      did he? Ye'd trick me, would ye? Now, by the belly
      of St. George&#8212;" At this point, though the velvet
      gallant had swiftly drawn in turn, the group having
      opened a clear space at the captain's first exclamation,
      Ravenshaw broke off to another thought.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_52"
          name="Page_52">[52]</a></span>
      "Nay, we'll go after that hound first; the scent's
      warm yet; and then we'll look to you. Come, lads
      of mine!"</p>
    <p>He dashed through the group, and headed for
      Cheapside; his four pupils and the two link-boys
      tarried not from following him. The other gentlemen
      looked to their leader for direction; whereupon
      he, as the tavern door opened, put up his sword and,
      laughing quietly, led them into the house.</p>
    <p>"They'll be rare dogs an they catch Jerningham,"
      quoth he. "The fools! their noise would warn him
      even if they should chance upon his track."</p>
    <p>The captain and his companions found Bread
      Street and Cheapside black, silent of human sounds,
      and, wherever they carried their lights, empty of
      human forms. They traversed two or three of the
      side streets, and listened at the corners of others,
      but without result. Where, in this night-wrapped
      London, did the two objects of their search now
      draw breath?</p>
    <p>If the girl had indeed not had far to go, she was
      probably safe; and if she were safe the man's doings
      mattered little. So, and as the gallants were beginning
      to show signs of weariness, the inspiriting effect
      of their last wine having died out, the captain piloted
      them back to the tavern at whose door he had left
      his quarrel scarce begun.</p>
    <p>He found the tavern door barred; and no amount<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_53"
          name="Page_53">[53]</a></span>
      of knocking and shouting sufficed to open it. The
      tired gallants were yawning, leaning against one
      another (they dared not lean against the tavern,
      lest something might be dropped upon them from
      an upper window), and talking of bed. Therefore
      the captain drew off to a safe distance from the
      tavern, and thus addressed his following:</p>
    <p>"Ye have had but a poor lesson in swaggering
      to-night, masters. To be true roaring boys, we
      should have forced a brawl on those gallants&#8212;rather
      for the brawl's sake than for the girl's. To
      help the helpless hath nought to do with true swaggering,
      save where it may be a pretext. But this
      lambkin looked so tender, I forgot myself, and behaved
      discreetly, seeing her cause was best served
      that way. The essence of roaring is not in concern
      for the cause, but in putting down the enemy. If
      you be in the wrong, so much the greater your
      credit as a bully. And now, if we wait for those
      cozeners to come forth&#8212;"</p>
    <p>"Oh, let 'em come forth and be damned," said
      Master Clarington, sleepily. "I'm for bed. Light
      me to my lodging, boy. Who'll keep me company
      to Coleman Street?"</p>
    <p>As the three other young gentlemen had, at the
      time, their city lodgings in that direction, they were
      quite ready to avail themselves of Master Clarington's
      initiative in yielding to the claims of fatigue.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_54"
          name="Page_54">[54]</a></span>
      The captain was not such a fool as to risk their
      favour by opposing their decision, seeing how their
      zest for adventure had oozed out of them. He
      therefore accompanied them northward through Bow
      Lane with outward cheerfulness. On the way, he
      considered within himself whether or not to fish for
      an invitation to a night's lodging, or for the loan
      of money to pay for a bed himself. He bethought
      him that man was fickle, particularly in the case
      of would-be daredevils who soon grew sleepy on their
      wine; if he would retain the patronage of these four,
      he must not go too far upon it at first. He had too
      much experience to sacrifice to-morrow's pound for
      to-night's shilling. So, when he came to Cheapside,
      where his companions should turn eastward, he
      stopped, and said:</p>
    <p>"I must wish ye good night here, gentlemen.
      You will be at the Windmill again to-morrow, mayhap?"</p>
    <p>"What?" said Master Maylands, carelessly. "Go
      you no farther our way? Where lodge you, then?"</p>
    <p>"Oh, I lodge out Newgate way," replied the captain,
      vaguely. "A good night to ye all! Ye'll find
      me at the Windmill after dinner. Merry dreams,
      lads! Faith, I shall be glad to get under cover;
      the wind is higher, methinks."</p>
    <p>A chorus of good nights answered him drowsily,
      and he was left in darkness, the link-boys going with<span class="pagenum"><a
          id="Page_55" name="Page_55">[55]</a></span>
      the four gentlemen, who hung upon one another's
      arms as they plodded unsteadily along.</p>
    <p>The captain trudged westward in Cheapside, in
      mechanical obedience to the suggestion pertaining
      to his lie.</p>
    <p>"I should better have got myself taken up of the
      watch," he mused, as he gathered his new cloak
      about him, and made himself small against the wind.
      "Then I should have lain warm in the Counter.
      That scholar is a lucky fellow. But that would
      have lost me the opinion of my four sparks. Well,
      it shall go hard but they continue bountiful. Cloak,
      doublet, and bonnet already&#8212;a good night's booty.
      'Tis well I found 'em in the right degree of drink.
      As for that wench&#8212;I was an ass, I should have
      let those roysterers have their way of her; 'twould
      have served my grudge against the sex. But such a
      child&#8212;! Hey! What fellow comes here with the
      lantern and the wide breeches? An it be a constable,
      I'll vilify him, and be lodged in the Counter
      yet. How now, rascal!&#8212;what, Moll, is it thou, up
      to thy vixen tricks again?"</p>
    <p>The newcomer, who now faced Ravenshaw and
      held up a lantern to see him the better, wore a
      man's doublet and hose, and a sword; but a careful
      scrutiny of the bold features would have revealed to
      any one that they were those of a sturdy young
      woman, of the lower class. The daughter of Frith,<span class="pagenum"><a
          id="Page_56" name="Page_56">[56]</a></span>
      the shoemaker of Aldersgate, had yet to immortalise
      herself as Moll Cutpurse, but she had some time
      since run away from domestic service and taken to
      wearing men's clothes.</p>
    <p>"Good even, Bully Ravenshaw," quoth she, in a
      hoarse, vigorous voice. "Why do you walk the
      night, old roaring boy?"</p>
    <p>"For want of a lodging, young roaring girl."</p>
    <p>"Is it so? Look ye, then; I'm abroad for the
      night, on matters of mine own. Here's my key;
      'tis to the back yard gate of the empty house in
      Foster Lane, where the spirit walks. Dost fear
      ghosts?"</p>
    <p>"Fear ghosts? Girl, I make 'em!"</p>
    <p>"Then you'll find in that yard a penthouse,
      wherein is a feather-bed upon boards. 'Tis a good
      bed&#8212;I stole it from a brewer's widow."</p>
    <p>And so the captain lodged that night in a coal-house,
      thankfully.</p>
    <hr class="chap" />
    <p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_57" name="Page_57">[57]</a></span></p>
    <h2><a id="CHAPTER_III" name="CHAPTER_III">CHAPTER III.</a></h2>
    <div class="center">MASTER JERNINGHAM'S MADNESS.</div>
    <blockquote>
      <p>"I must and will obtain her; I am ashes else."&#8212;<i>The Humourous
          Lieutenant.</i></p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>Now it happened that while Captain Ravenshaw
      and his companions were speeding up Bread Street
      toward Cheapside, the Spanish-hatted gentleman of
      whom they were in quest was plodding down Friday
      Street toward the tavern at whose door they
      had left his friends. When he arrived there, he
      gave a knock similar to that which had served to
      open the house to the handsome gallant of the
      double-pointed beard; and presently, after being
      inspected through a small grating in the door, he
      was admitted.</p>
    <p>"Is Sir Clement Ermsby above?" he asked the
      sleepy menial who had let him in.</p>
    <p>"Yes, your worship. An't please you, he and his
      friends came in but a little while ago. They're in
      the Neptune room. A cold night, your worship."</p>
    <p>"How many of his friends?"</p>
    <p>"Three, sir. There were e'en five or six more
      with him outside, at first; but they went their ways.
      Methinks there was some quarrel, but I know not."</p>
    <p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_58" name="Page_58">[58]</a></span></p>
    <p>The gentleman pushed his hat back from his
      brow, and looked a trifle relieved. He stood for
      a moment with his eye on the servant, as if to see
      that the man barred the door properly, and then he
      went up-stairs to a room at the rear of the tavern.
      The tapestry of this chamber represented the sea,
      with the ocean god and a multitude of other marine
      figures. Around the fire sat the newcomer's friends,
      smoking pipes; they greeted him with laughter.</p>
    <p>"Ho, ho!" cried the handsome gallant. "She
      'scaped you, after all! The pinnace was too fleet!"</p>
    <p>"I gained all I wished," said the broad-breasted
      gentleman, coolly, speaking in curt syllables. "I
      had no mind to close in combat. I did not even
      let her know I was giving chase. But I saw what
      port she made into; I know where to seek her when
      the time is propitious."</p>
    <p>With a faint smile of triumph over his comrades,
      the gentleman, who had thrown off his plain cloak
      while speaking, stepped close to the fire, removed
      his gloves, and began to warm his fingers. He was
      of middle stature, thick-bodied, heavily bearded, of a
      brown complexion; his expression of face was melancholy,
      moody, dreamy; as he gazed into the fire he
      seemed lost in his own thoughts. His momentary
      smile had brought a singularly sweet and noble light
      into his face; but that light had vanished with the
      smile.</p>
    <p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_59" name="Page_59">[59]</a></span></p>
    <p>"I must thank you, Ermsby, and all of ye," he
      said, after a short silence. "You drew the fellow
      away like the best of cozeners. How got you rid
      of him so soon?"</p>
    <p>"Faith, by his taking note of your absence, and
      guessing what was afoot," replied the handsome gallant.
      "He's e'en looking for you now. A murrain
      on him! his ribs should have felt steel, but for thy
      fear of a brawl, Jerningham."</p>
    <p>"Thou'rt a fool, Ermsby," answered Jerningham,
      continuing to gaze with saturnine countenance into
      the fire; "and my daring to call thee so tells how
      much I fear a fight for its own sake. How often
      must I put it to you in plain terms? If I be found
      concerned in roystering or rioting, I forfeit the countenance
      of my pious kinsman, the bishop. With
      that I forfeit the further use of his money in our
      enterprise. Without his money, how are we to complete
      the fitting of our ship? No ship, no voyage.
      No voyage, no possessing the fertile islands; and so
      no fortune, and there's an end. Pish, man, shall we
      lose all for a sight of some unknown rascal's filthy
      blood? Not I. You shall see me play the very
      Puritan till the day my ship lifts anchor for the
      Western seas."</p>
    <p>"You have played the Puritan to-night, sooth,"
      said Ermsby. "To steal after a wench under cover
      of night, and find out her house for your hidden<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_60"
          name="Page_60">[60]</a></span>
      purposes in future,&#8212;there's the soul of Puritanism.
      Where does she live?"</p>
    <p>"I'll still be puritanical, and keep that knowledge
      to myself," said Jerningham, with the least touch of
      a smile.</p>
    <p>"Nay, man, the secret is ours, too!" protested
      Ermsby. "We helped you to it. Come, you had
      best tell; that will put us on our honour to leave her
      all to you. If you don't, by my conscience, I'll hunt
      high and low till I find out for myself, and then I
      won't acknowledge any right of yours to her. Tell
      us, and make us your abettors; or tell us not, and
      make us your rivals."</p>
    <p>Jerningham was silent for a moment, while he
      motioned the attending servant to pour him out some
      wine; then, evidently knowing his men, he replied:</p>
    <p>"She led me but a short chase; which was well,
      as I had to go upon my toes&#8212;the sound of her steps
      was all I had to guide me. When the sound stopped,
      in Friday Street, I heard the creaking of a gate; it
      meant she had gone into a back yard. I went on
      softly, feeling the walls with my hands, till I came to
      the gate; and there I heard a key turning in a door.
      I had naught to do but find out what house the gate
      belonged to. 'Twas the house at the corner of
      Cheapside."</p>
    <p>"And Friday Street? Which side of Friday
      Street?"</p>

      <div class="figcenter">
         <img src="images/i_60fp.jpg" width="387" height="592" alt=""/>
         <p class="center">"'SHE LED ME BUT A SHORT CHASE.'"</p>
      </div>

        <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span></p>
    <p>"The east side. 'Tis a goldsmith's shop. Does
      any one know what goldsmith dwells there?"</p>
    <p>No one remembered. These were all gentlemen
      who, when they were not at sea, divided most of
      their time between the country and the court; at
      present they lodged toward the Charing Cross end of
      the Strand, in a row of houses opposite the riverside
      palaces of the great. But Jerningham himself
      lived with his kinsman, the bishop, in Winchester
      House, across the Thames.</p>
    <p>"Time enough to learn that, and win a score
      of goldsmith's daughters, and tire of 'em too, ere
      the ship is fitted," said Ermsby, losing interest in the
      subject; whereupon the conversation shifted to the
      matter of the ship, then being repaired at Deptford.</p>
    <p>From this they fell to dicing,&#8212;all but Jerningham,
      who sat looking steadily before him, as if he
      saw visions through the clouds of tobacco smoke he
      sent forth. Presently was heard the noise of pounding
      at the street door below.</p>
    <p>"'Tis that rascal come back, ten to one; he has
      given over hunting you," said Ermsby to Jerningham.</p>
    <p>"Then be sure you open not, Timothy," said
      Jerningham, addressing the tavern drawer who was
      staying up to wait upon those privileged to use the
      house after closing hours.</p>
    <p>"No fear," replied Timothy. "They may hammer
      till they be dead, an they give not the right<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_62"
          name="Page_62">[62]</a></span>
      knock. I'll e'en go look down from the front
      window, and see who 'tis."</p>
    <p>Ermsby went with him; and presently returned
      with him, saying:</p>
    <p>"'Tis our man; and Timothy here knows him. It
      seems he is one Ravenshaw, a roaring captain. I've
      heard of the fellow; he talks loud in taverns, and
      will fight any man for sixpence; a kind of ranger of
      Turnbull Street&#8212;"</p>
    <p>"Nay," corrected Timothy; "he is no counterfeit,
      as most of those rangers be. He roars, and brags,
      and looks fierce, as they do; but he was with Sir
      John Norris in Portugal and France, and he can use
      the rapier, or rapier and dagger, with any man that
      ever came out of Saviolo's school. I have seen him
      with the foils, in this very room, when he made all
      the company wonder. And 'tis well known what
      duels he has fought. One time, in Hogsdon
      fields&#8212;"</p>
    <p>"Oh, that is the man, is it?" said Jerningham,
      cutting off the drawer's threatened torrent of reminiscence.
      "Then so much the better he has grown
      tired of beating at the door. He has gone away, I
      trust. As ye love me, gentlemen, no scandals till the
      ship is armed, provisioned, manned, and ready every
      way for the tide that shall bear us down the Thames."</p>
    <p>"And look that you bring no scandal in your siege
      of this goldsmith's daughter," said Ermsby, jocularly.</p>
    <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span></p>
    <p>"Trust me for that," replied Jerningham.</p>
    <p>It was several weeks after this night, and the
      chilling frown of winter had given place to the smile
      of May, when, upon a sunny morning, Sir Clement
      Ermsby, followed by a young page, stepped from a
      Thames wherry at Winchester stairs to confer with
      Master Jerningham upon the last preparations for
      their voyage. They were to sail in three days.</p>
    <p>Jerningham was pacing the terrace, frowning upon
      the ground at his feet, his look more moody than
      ever, and with something distraught in it; now and
      then he drew in his breath audibly between his lips,
      or allowed some restless movement of the hands to
      belie his customary self-control.</p>
    <p>"What a devil is it afflicts you, man?" was Ermsby's
      greeting, while his page stood at a respectful
      distance, and began playing with two greyhounds
      that came bounding up. "This manner is something
      new. I've seen it for a week in you. Beshrew
      me if I don't think an evil spirit has crept
      into you. What's the matter?"</p>
    <p>"Nothing's the matter," said Jerningham, in a
      growling tone. "'Tis my humour."</p>
    <p>"'Tis a humour there's no excuse for, then, on a
      day like this, and with such a prospect before one's
      eyes." As Sir Clement spoke, he looked over the
      balustrade to the Thames and the countless-gabled
      front of the spire-studded city.</p>
    <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span></p>
    <p>The Thames and London were fair to see then.
      The river was wider than it is now, and was comparatively
      clean. Swans floated upon its surface,
      and it was lively with passenger craft,&#8212;sailboats,
      rowboats, tilt-boats, and boats with wooden cabins,
      gaily decorated barges belonging to royalty and
      nobility. The Thames, with its numerous landing-stairs,
      was the principal highway of London. When
      the queen went from Whitehall to Greenwich, it was,
      of course, by this water thoroughfare. It was the
      more convenient way of transit between the city and
      Westminster, where the courts were held. It had
      but one bridge at London then,&#8212;the old London
      Bridge of the children's song, "London Bridge is
      falling down;" the bridge that was a veritable street
      of houses, and which stood some distance east of
      where the present London Bridge stands. To many
      people the better way of crossing to Southwark,
      when they went to the playhouses or the bear-gardens,
      was by boat. Water-men were at every
      landing-place, soliciting custom. When at work,
      they often sang as they plied the oars. The rich,
      when they would amuse themselves upon the river
      in their handsome tilt-boats, took musicians with
      them. On a fine May day, in the reign of Elizabeth,
      when the little green waves sparkled in the sunshine,
      the Thames alone was a sight worth looking at from
      the terrace of Winchester House, which, as every<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_65"
          name="Page_65">[65]</a></span>body
      knows, was on the Southwark side, west of
      the beautiful Church of St. Mary Overie (now St.
      Saviour's), and which thus commanded a fine view
      of river and city-front.</p>
    <p>Beginning at the far west, where the river came
      into sight after passing Westminster and Whitehall,
      its northern bank presented first the long row of
      great houses that came as far as to the Temple,&#8212;houses
      that were really town castles, with spacious
      gardens, whose river walls were broken by gates,
      whence were steps descending to the water. Nearer,
      grew the stately trees of the Temple garden; nearer
      yet, rose from the river's edge the frowning walls of
      the Bridewell, once a palace, and of Baynard's Castle.
      And here the eye was drawn up and back from the
      water-front, which henceforth abounded with wharves,
      by the huge bulk of St. Paul's, which stood amidst a
      multitude of ordinary buildings like a giant among
      pigmies,&#8212;the old St. Paul's, Gothic, with its square
      tower in the centre, its crosses crowning the ends
      and corners, its delicate pinnacles rising from its
      flying buttresses, its beautiful doorways and rose
      windows. Coming still eastward, the eye swept a
      great mass of gabled houses ascending in irregular
      tiers from the river, the sky-line broken by church
      towers and steeples innumerable. Directly opposite
      Winchester House, the river stairs that fell from the
      tall, narrow buildings were mainly for commercial<span class="pagenum"><a
          id="Page_66" name="Page_66">[66]</a></span>
      uses. A little further east, the view was shut in by
      the close-packed houses on the bridge, so that one
      could not see the Tower, or the larger shipping off
      the wharves in the lower river.</p>
    <p>But this morning the sight was nothing to Master
      Jerningham, whose only answer to his friend was to
      look the more harassed and woebegone. Ermsby
      suddenly took alarm.</p>
    <p>"How now? Has anything ill befallen at Deptford?"
      he asked.</p>
    <p>"No. All goes forward fast&#8212;too fast." And
      Jerningham sighed.</p>
    <p>"How too fast? How can that be? Good God,
      man, have you lost heart for the voyage?"</p>
    <p>"Never that. You know me better. But we
      shall soon be sailing, and the hours go, and yet I
      am no further with&#8212;oh, a plague on secrecy, 'tis
      that wench. There is no way under heaven I
      can even get speech of her."</p>
    <p>"What wench?" inquired Ermsby, in whose
      thoughts there had been more than one wench
      since the reader first made his acquaintance.</p>
    <p>"What wench! Gods above, is there more than
      one?&#8212;worth a man's lying awake at night to sigh
      for, I mean."</p>
    <p>"And is there one such, then? Faith, an there
      be, I have not seen her of late."</p>
    <p>"Yes, you have. Scarce three months ago."</p>
    <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span></p>
    <p>"That's three ages, where women are concerned.
      Who is this incomparable she?"</p>
    <p>"That goldsmith's daughter&#8212;you remember the
      night we chased her from Cheapside down Bread
      Street, and came near a quarrel with Ravenshaw
      the bully, and I followed to see where she lived?"</p>
    <p>"Faith, I remember. A pretty little thing. And
      she has held you off all this time? Man, man,
      you must have blundered terribly! What plan of
      campaign have you employed against her?"</p>
    <p>"I have not been able to pass words with her,
      I tell you. She rarely goes forth from home at
      all, and when she does 'tis with both parents, and
      a woman, and a stout 'prentice or two. I have
      stood in wait night after night, thinking she might
      try to run away again; but she has not."</p>
    <p>"Why, you know not your first letter in the
      study of how to woo citizens' womankind. Go to
      her father's shop while she is there, and contrive
      to have her wait upon you. Flattery, vows, and
      promises sound all the softer for being whispered
      over a counter."</p>
    <p>"I have watched, and when I have been busy
      at the ship, my man Gregory has watched. But
      she never comes into the shop. She has a devil
      of shrewdness for a father; a rock-faced man, of
      few words, with eyes on everything. He already
      suspects me; for now whenever I go near his shop<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_68"
          name="Page_68">[68]</a></span>
      he comes from his business and stares at me as
      if he offered defiance."</p>
    <p>"A plague on these citizens. They dare outface
      gentlemen nowadays. They are so rich, and the
      law is on their side, curse 'em! A goldsmith thinks
      himself as good as a lord."</p>
    <p>"This one has taught his very 'prentices to look
      big at me as I pass. And Gregory&#8212;he is a sly
      hound, as you know, and when I put him on his
      mettle for the conveyance of a letter to the girl's
      waiting-woman, he was ready to sell himself to the
      devil for the wit to accomplish it. But he could
      not; and they have smelt a purpose in his doings,
      too. The last time he went near the shop, and
      stood trying to get the eye of some serving-maid at
      a window, two of the goldsmith's 'prentices came
      out and, pretending not to see him, ran hard against
      him and laid him sprawling in the street."</p>
    <p>"And he let them go with whole skins? Had
      he no dagger?"</p>
    <p>"Of what use? They are very stout fellows,
      all in that shop. And they would have had only
      to cry 'Clubs,' and every 'prentice in Cheapside
      would have come to cudgel Gregory to death.
      They have too many privileges in the city, pox on
      'em!"</p>
    <p>"You should have begun by making friends with
      the goldsmith openly, and so got access to his house.<span class="pagenum"><a
          id="Page_69" name="Page_69">[69]</a></span>
      Then you could have cozened him when the time
      came."</p>
    <p>"But 'tis too late for that now. Besides, these
      citizens distrust a man the first moment, when they
      have wives and daughters. Oh, we have tried every
      way, both myself and Gregory. Gregory found a
      pot-boy, at the White Horse tavern, that knew one
      of the maids in the house, and we tried to pass a
      letter by means of those two. But the letter got
      into the father's hands, and the maid was cast off,
      and I'm glad I signed a false name. I know not
      if Mistress Millicent ever saw the letter."</p>
    <p>"Is Millicent her name?"</p>
    <p>"Ay. She is the only child. Her father is
      Thomas Etheridge, the goldsmith, at the sign of the
      Golden Acorn, in Cheapside at the corner of Friday
      Street. And nothing more do I know of her, but
      that I am going mad for her. And now that I have
      opened all to you, in God's name tell me what I
      shall do. Though we sail in three days, I must have
      her in my arms for one sweet hour, at least, ere
      I go. Laugh if you will! Call it madness. 'Tis
      the worse, then, and the more needs quenching.
      What shall I do?"</p>
    <p>"Use a better messenger; one that can get the
      ear of the maid and yet 'scape the eye of the father;
      one that can win her to a meeting with you. Such
      things are managed daily. Howsoever hedged by<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_70"
          name="Page_70">[70]</a></span>
      husbands, or fenced by fathers, the fair ones of the
      city are still to be come at. Employ a go-between."</p>
    <p>"Have I not tried Gregory? Where he has
      failed, how shall any other servant fare? Not one
      of those at my command has a tithe of his wit. Nor
      has any of our sea-rogues."</p>
    <p>"Why, the look of being a gentleman's serving-man
      will damn any knave in the eye of a wary
      citizen, nowadays. And Gregory hath the face of
      a rascal besides. Employ none of that degree. As
      for our sea-rogues, we chose 'em witless, for our
      own advantage."</p>
    <p>"Troth, you might serve me in this matter,
      Ermsby. You have the wit; and you should find
      good pastime in it."</p>
    <p>"Faith, not I. I know the taste of 'prentice's
      cudgel. I'll tell you a tale; 'twill warn you that,
      when love's path leads into the city, you'd best see
      it made sure and smooth ere you tread it yourself.
      One day as I was going to the play in Blackfriars,
      my glance fell upon as handsome a piece of female
      citizenship as you'll meet any day 'twixt Fleet Street
      and the Tower. She saw me looking, and looked in
      turn; and I resolved to let the play go hang, and
      follow her. She had with her an old woman and a
      'prentice boy, and her look seemed to advise me not
      to accost her in their presence. So I walked behind
      her, smiling my sweetest each time she turned her<span class="pagenum"><a
          id="Page_71" name="Page_71">[71]</a></span>
      head around. She led me into a grocer's shop in
      Bucklersbury. I could see by her manner there
      that she was at home; there was no husband in
      sight, the shop being kept by two 'prentices. Here
      she forthwith sent the woman up-stairs, and turned
      as if she would attend upon me herself. Now,
      thought I, my happiness is soon to be assured; and
      I was rejoicing within, for each time I had seen her
      face she had looked more lovely. Sooth, the ripeness
      of those lips&#8212;!"</p>
    <p>"Well, well, what happened?"</p>
    <p>"I went but to open the matter with a courteous
      kiss on the cheek; but the more luscious fruit hung
      too near, so I stopped me at the lips instead, and
      stopped overlong there. She made pretence&#8212;I
      swear 'twas pretence&#8212;to push me away, and to be
      much angry and abused. But the zany 'prentices
      knew not this virtuous resistance was make-believe,
      and they ran at me as if I were some thief caught in
      the act. I met the first with a clout in the face, but
      they were stout knaves and made nothing of laying
      hands upon me. I shook them off, and then, being
      at the back of the shop, drew my sword to ensure
      my passage to the street. But that instant they
      raised the cry, 'Clubs!' and ran and got their own
      cudgels, and came menacing me again. While I
      was making play with my rapier, thinking to fright
      them off, all the 'prentices in Bucklersbury began to<span class="pagenum"><a
          id="Page_72" name="Page_72">[72]</a></span>
      pour into the shop, shouting clubs and brandishing
      'em at the same time. I saw there was naught to
      do but cut my way through by letting out the blood
      of any grocer's knave or 'pothecary's boy that should
      stand before me. But ere I had made two thrusts
      in earnest, my rapier was knocked from my hand by
      a club. A cloud of other clubs rained on my head,
      shoulders, and body. And so I cowered helpless,
      seeing nothing before me but the chance of being
      pounded to a jelly by the crowd."</p>
    <p>"And what miracle occurred?"</p>
    <p>"The wit of woman intervened. She that I had
      followed laid hold of some box or bag, and thrust
      her fingers in, and began flinging the contents by
      handfuls into the air. It was ground pepper. In a
      moment every man Jack in the shop was sneezing as
      if there were a prize for it. Such a shaking, and
      bending forward of bodies, and holding of noses, was
      never seen elsewhere. Every fellow was taken with
      a sneezing fit that lasted minutes, for the woman
      still threw the pepper about, regardless of the work
      it had done. Limp and half-blind as every rascal
      was, and busied with each new spasm coming on,
      they paid no more heed to me; and so, sneezing like
      the rest, I pushed through unregarded to the street.
      I fled down Walbrook, and came not to an end of
      sneezing till I had taken boat at Dowgate wharf. I
      went home, then, and put my bruises to bed; and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_73"
          name="Page_73">[73]</a></span>
      I know not how many days it was till I had done
      aching. Be thankful thou hast not fared in the
      goldsmith's shop e'en worse than I fared in the
      grocer's; for there is no pepper kept in goldsmith's
      shops."</p>
    <p>"I know not then what kind of emissary to send.
      As you say, a serving-man is too easily seen through.
      A gentleman will not risk the cudgel. I know a
      lawyer, a beggarly knave eager for any sort of
      questionable transaction."</p>
    <p>"Nay, he'll make a botch of it, as lawyers do of
      everything they set their hands to."</p>
    <p>"How if I tried a woman? 'Tis often done, I
      believe. As thieves are set to catch thieves, so set
      a woman&#8212;"</p>
    <p>"Ay, women have zest for the business; especially
      the tainted ones&#8212;they joy to infect their sisters
      whose purity they secretly envy. They that have
      spots take comfort in company, as misery doth.
      Yet they will serve you ill; for they ever bring
      entanglement on those they weave their plots for,
      as well as on those they weave against. City husbands
      and fathers have grown wiser, too; they've
      learned to look for love-plots in their women's
      fellowship with other women. Unless you'd risk
      some chance of failure with this maid&#8212;"</p>
    <p>"By God, that I will not! I must have a sure
      messenger."</p>
    <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span></p>
    <p>"I would mine own page yonder had the wit,
      that I might lend him. But when I choose a
      servant, 'tis rather for lack of wit in him; else he
      might take it into his head to outwit his master.
      My boy there serves well enough to carry sonnets
      to court ladies; but he would never do for your
      business. You say this goldsmith is watchful.
      Therefore, you want a man the most unlike the
      common go-betweens in such affairs; a man that
      looks the last in the world to be chosen as love's
      ambassador."</p>
    <p>"Some venerable Puritan, perchance," said Jerningham,
      with the slight irony of one not quite
      convinced.</p>
    <p>"Ay, if one could be found needy enough to
      want your money; but that's hopeless. We must
      seek a poor devil that hath a good wit and can
      act a part. If we had one such in our ship's company&#8212;What,
      Gregory! Have you been listening, knave?"</p>
    <p>Sir Clement's break was caused by his perceiving,
      upon suddenly turning around, that Jerningham's
      man stood near, with a suspicious cock
      of the head. This Gregory was just the fellow
      to steal up without noise; he had long cultivated
      the silent footfall. He was a lean man of about
      thirty-five years; a little bent, and with a long
      neck, so that his head always seemed hastening<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_75"
          name="Page_75">[75]</a></span>
      before his body, which could never catch up. He
      had a small, sharp face, of an ashen complexion,
      and with fishy, greenish eyes; his expression was
      that of cunning cloaked in calm impudence.</p>
    <p>"No offence, sirs," said he, glibly, stepping
      forward with bowed head. "I couldn't help hearing
      a little. If I may say so, sirs, my master
      needn't yet look abroad for one to do his business.
      I think I have a shift or two still, if I may be
      so bold."</p>
    <p>"You may not be so bold, Gregory," said Jerningham.
      "Disguises are well enough in Spanish tales
      and stage plays; but you'd be caught, and all
      brought home to me and the bishop's ears. He
      could stay our ship at the last hour, an he had a
      mind to. Go to; and do and speak when you are
      bid, not else."</p>
    <p>The serving-man stepped back, looking humiliated.</p>
    <p>"He's already green with jealousy of the man
      you shall employ," said Ermsby, with unkind amusement
      at the knave's discomfiture.</p>
    <p>"Ay, he's touchy that way. A faithful dog&#8212;and
      bound to be so, for I know a thing or two
      that would hang him. But to reach this maid, I
      must have another Mercury. Where shall I find
      this witty poor rascal that is to cozen old Argus,
      her father, and get me access to her?"</p>
    <p>"Why, but for going to Deptford, we might seek<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_76"
          name="Page_76">[76]</a></span>
      him forthwith. The hour before dinner is the right
      time. But&#8212;"</p>
    <p>"Then let us seek. There's no need we go to
      Deptford to-day. We cannot haste matters at the
      ship; all's in good hands there. In God's name,
      come find me this fellow."</p>
    <p>"Bid Gregory hail a boat, then," said Ermsby;
      and, after the servant had been sent ahead to the
      stairs on that errand, and Ermsby had motioned
      his own page to go thither, he continued: "We
      shall go to Paul's first, where we got so many of
      our shipmates; there we shall have choice of half
      the penniless companions, starved wits, masterless
      men, cast soldiers, skulking debtors, and serviceable
      rascals in London. Of a surety, you can buy any
      service there; there's truth in what the plays
      say."</p>
    <p>The two gentlemen, attended by Gregory and
      the page, were soon embarked in a wherry whose
      prow the watermen headed against the current,
      the destination being some distance up-stream on
      the opposite bank.</p>
    <p>"What of Meg Falkner?" Ermsby said, suddenly,
      in a tone too low for the servants to hear. "Are
      you rid of her yet?"</p>
    <p>Jerningham's brow turned darker by a shade.</p>
    <p>"That were as great a puzzle as to reach this
      goldsmith's wench," he replied. "I would have<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_77"
          name="Page_77">[77]</a></span>
      married her to Gregory; it seemed no mean fate for
      a yeoman's daughter that had buried a brat; but
      she'd have none of that. I durs'n't turn her out lest
      she make a noise that might come to the bishop.
      I'm lucky she hath kept quiet, as it is."</p>
    <p>"She lives still at your country-house?"</p>
    <p>"Ay; where else to lodge her? Rotten as it is, it
      does for that; and that is the only use it hath done
      me this many a year. There's a cow or two for her
      maintaining, and some hens. And for company,
      there's old Jeremy that's half-blind. He can quiet
      her fears o' nights, when the timbers creak and she
      thinks it is a ghost walking."</p>
    <p>"And what of the house when you are away on
      the voyage?"</p>
    <p>"Troth, all may out then, I care not! Let 'em
      sell the estate for the debts on it; they'll find themselves
      losers, I trow. And Mistress Meg will be left
      in the lurch, poor white-face! As for me, when the
      ship sails, I shall be quit of that plague."</p>
    <p>"Ay, but you'll be quit of this goldsmith's wench,
      too. Will your 'one sweet hour' or so suffice, think
      you?"</p>
    <p>The faintest smile came into Jerningham's face.</p>
    <p>"I will not prophesy," said he, softly. "But, as
      you well know, when we come to that island, if all
      goes well, I shall be in some sort a king there."</p>
    <p>"Certainly; but what of that, touching this wench?"</p>
    <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span></p>
    <p>"Why, will not the island have room for a queen
      as well?"</p>
    <p>"Oho!" quoth Ermsby, after a short silence. "So
      the wind blows that way in thy dreams!"</p>
    <p>Presently they landed at Paul's Wharf, climbed to
      Thames Street, which was noisy with carts and drays,
      and went on up a narrow thoroughfare toward the
      great church.</p>

    <p>On the February morning when he rose from bed
      in the coal-house attached to the haunted dwelling
      in Foster Lane, Captain Ravenshaw waited about the
      yard for Moll Frith to return from her excursion of
      the night. When she appeared, he gave her back
      the key to the gate, and borrowed two angels from
      her. Armed with these, he bade her repent of her
      sins, and hastened to Cheapside, turning eastward
      with the purpose of finding out how and where his
      new friend, the scholar, fared in the hands of the
      law.</p>
    <p>Cheapside, which was in a double sense the Broadway
      of Elizabethan London, was already thronged
      with people going about their business, the shops
      and booths of the merchants being open, and the
      shopmen and 'prentices crying out their wares with
      the customary "What d'ye lack?" At the great
      conduit, the captain pushed his way through the
      crowd of jesting and quarrelling water-carriers who
      were filling their vessels, and washed his hands and<span class="pagenum"><a

      face. Looking about for a means of drying himself,
      while the water dripped from his features, he espied
      a woman with a pitcher, to whom the uncouth water-carriers
      would not give place. The captain knocked
      several of them aside, gallantly took the woman by
      the hand, led her to the fountain, and enabled her
      to fill her pitcher. While she was doing this, he,
      with courteous gestures, took her kerchief from her
      head and dried himself therewith; after which he
      returned it with a bow so polite that, between her
      amazement and her sense of flattery, she could not
      find it in her to say a word against the proceeding.</p>
    <p>Going on his way refreshed, the captain suddenly
      met Master Holyday, who looked as unconcerned as
      if he had never been near a prison in his life.</p>
    <p>"What, lad, did not the watch take thee, then?"</p>
    <p>"Yes, faith, and kept me all night in a cage, where
      I think I have turned foul inside with the smell of
      stale tobacco smoke. I am come but now from the
      justice's hall."</p>
    <p>"Man, you've had a quick journey of it. By this
      light, you must have found money in those new
      clothes, and tickled the palm of a constable."</p>
    <p>"No; the justice might have sent me back to the
      stinking hole, for all the money I had to give anybody.
      When he asked me my name, I bethought
      me to reply, 'Sir Ralph Holyday;' which was no
      more than my right at Cambridge, when I became<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_81"
          name="Page_81">[81]</a></span>
      a graduate there. But, seeing me in these clothes
      instead of in black, the justice thought the 'Sir' was
      of knighthood, not of scholarship. And so he said
      he could make nothing out of the watchmen's stories,
      which agreed not. I then addressed him respectfully
      in Latin; and, lest it might be seen that he
      did not understand me, he got rid of me forthwith."</p>
    <p>"We'll drink his health&#8212;but not yet. While I
      have money to show, we'll bespeak lodgings, and so
      make sure of sleeping indoors, for a week o' nights,
      come what may. These clothes will get us curtseys
      and smiles from any hostess&#8212;except them that
      have already lodged me."</p>
    <p>"Ay, we are fine enough above the waist, but our
      poor legs and feet are sorry company for our upper
      halves."</p>
    <p>"Why, we must see to that when we meet our
      four asses again. Meanwhile our cloaks will cover
      us to the knees, and if we carry our heads high
      enough, nobody will dare look scornful at our feet.
      Remember, we are gallants while these clothes last;
      swaggering gallants, that give the wall to no man.
      And while we go seek lodgings, I'll tell thee how
      thou shalt earn thy share of these coxcombs' wastings.
      Hast ever travelled abroad?"</p>
    <p>"No," said the scholar, falling into the captain's
      stride as the pair went westward.</p>
    <p>"No matter. Thou hast read books of other<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_82"
          name="Page_82">[82]</a></span>
      countries, and heard travellers tell of foreign
      cities?"</p>
    <p>"Yes; I've read and heard much; and remembered
      some of it."</p>
    <p>"Then bear in mind, you are a great traveller.
      Your gentleman that hath not been abroad is
      counted a poor thing among gallants. Now these
      four silken gulls have never been out of England,
      and they look sheepish whene'er a travelled man
      talks of France or Italy in their company. They
      would give much to pass for travelled gallants; to
      talk of French fashions and Italian vices without
      exposing their inexperience. You shall instruct 'em,
      so they may fool others as you fool them. I'll
      broach the matter softly, and in such a way that
      they shall see the value of it. Thus, while you fill
      'em up with tales of the foreign cities you have seen,
      we shall eat and drink at their cost. And so we
      shall hold 'em when they be tired of the swaggering
      lessons I mean to give 'em."</p>
    <p>"Well, I will do my best. What I don't know,
      I will e'en supply by invention. My stomach will
      inspire me, I trust."</p>
    <p>They took lodgings at the top of a house in St.
      Lawrence Lane, not far from its Cheapside end; and
      passed the time in walking about the streets till near
      noon, when they went to dinner at an ordinary where
      long tables were crowded with men of different de<span class="pagenum"><a
          id="Page_83" name="Page_83">[83]</a></span>grees,
      who dined abundantly and cheaply. The two
      companions finally repaired to the Windmill tavern,
      where they had to wait an hour before their young
      gentlemen appeared.</p>
    <p>The four were now sober, and showed hardly as
      much relish in meeting the captain as he might have
      wished. They cast somewhat rueful glances at the
      clothes they had given away in their vinous generosity,
      and which they had now replaced with other
      articles suitable to their quality. They manifested
      no eagerness for lessons in swaggering, and seemed
      at first to have forgotten any understanding they
      may have formed with the captain in regard thereto.</p>
    <p>But Ravenshaw was prepared for this apathy.
      He took the risk of inviting the gentlemen to drink,
      and with the air of an accustomed host he bowed
      them into the room to which a tapster directed him.
      He trusted they would be of different mood when
      the time to pay the score should come.</p>
    <p>A little drinking, and a few of the captain's tales,
      warmed them up to some enthusiasm for his society;
      and in an hour he had them urging him to proceed
      straightway to their further education in the art of
      roaring. After some reluctance and some unwillingness
      to believe that their proposal of the previous
      night had been serious, he was persuaded to consent.
      With the faintest grimace of triumph, for the eyes of
      Master Holyday alone, who smoked a pipe temper<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_84"
          name="Page_84">[84]</a></span>ately
      by the fire, he rose and began by illustrating
      how your true bully should "take the wall" of any
      man about to pass him in the street.</p>
    <p>The arras-hung partition of the room served as a
      street wall. The captain started at one end, Master
      Dauncey at the other. When the two met at the
      middle, the instructor enacted an elaborate scene of
      disputing the right to pass next the wall and so avoid
      the mud of the mid-street. He showed how to plant
      the feet, how to look fierce, how to finger the sword-hilt,
      what gestures to make; then what speeches to
      use, first of ironical courtesy, then of picturesque
      abuse, finally of daunting threat. Master Holyday,
      looking on from the fireplace, was amazed to
      see how much art could be displayed in what had
      ever seemed to him quite a simple matter. The
      captain went through every possible stage short of
      sword-thrusts; but there he stopped, saying that
      roaring ended where real fighting began.</p>
    <p>"If your man has not given way by this time," said
      he, "and you think he may be your better with the
      weapons, the next thing is to come gracefully out
      of the quarrel, by some jest or other shift. This
      is what many swaggering boys do, out of fear. When
      I do it myself, 'tis because I would avoid bloodshed,
      or out of mercy to my antagonist. But 'tis, in any
      case, a most important thing in the art of swaggering;
      I shall give examples of it in my next lesson."</p>
    <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span></p>
    <p>He then caused the gallants, in pairs, to go
      through such a scene as he had enacted. They
      made a foolish, perfunctory business of it at first,
      though he schooled them at every moment in attitude,
      gesture, or look, and supplied them with terms
      of revilement that made the scholar stare in admiration,
      and sanguinary threats before which a timid
      man might well tremble in his shoes.</p>
    <p>It would not do to carry his pupils too far forward
      at a step; he must keep them dependent upon him
      as long as possible. Nor was it safe to tire them
      with repetitions. So he put an end to the lesson in
      good time; and then, to hold them for the rest of
      the day, he set forth the possibility of their learning
      to pass as men that had travelled abroad. Master
      Holyday, while modestly admitting the extent of his
      wanderings in foreign countries, showed some disinclination
      to the task of imparting the observations
      he had made.</p>
    <p>"For, look ye," quoth he, "I once had a gossip
      whom I was wont to tell of things I had seen abroad.
      Like yourselves, he had never crossed the narrow
      seas; but by noting carefully my talk, he was able
      to make other people think he had travelled as far
      as I. There was one thing I had told him, which I
      had chanced to forget afterward. A dispute arose
      betwixt us one day, before company that knew not
      either of us well, touching certain customs in Venice.<span class="pagenum"><a
          id="Page_86" name="Page_86">[86]</a></span>
      By my not mentioning the thing I had forgot, and
      by his parading it as a matter well known, which
      others in the company knew to be the case, I was
      made a laughing-stock, and he got reputation as a
      great traveller. And to this day he keeps that
      reputation, all at my expense."</p>
    <p>This ingenious speech brought the desired insistence;
      and that very afternoon was begun, at Antwerp,
      an imaginary journey through the chief cities
      of Europe, in which were seen many things more
      astonishing than any foreign traveller had ever
      observed before.</p>
    <p>It took several evenings to go through Flanders
      and France, and would have taken more, but that,
      after the gallants had satisfied their curiosity regarding
      Paris, they were in haste to arrive in Italy as
      soon as might be. Italy was then the great playground
      of English travellers; the fashions came from
      there, so did the inspiration to art and literature;
      the French got their cookery and their vices from
      Italy; the English imported some of the vices, but
      not the cookery.</p>
    <p>While the scholar led his four charges from city
      to city by routes often unusual and sometimes impossible,
      Captain Ravenshaw conducted them stage by
      stage toward proficiency in swaggering. He showed
      them how differently to bully their betters, their
      equals, their inferiors; how to bully before company,<span class="pagenum"><a
          id="Page_87" name="Page_87">[87]</a></span>
      how without witnesses, how in the presence of ladies;
      how to overbear in every situation, from a simple
      jostle in the street to a dispute about a woman; how
      to meet a contradiction in argument, how to give and
      receive every degree of the lie, how to intimidate a
      winner out of the stakes at a gaming-table; and
      finally how, when the opponent was not to be talked
      down, either to slip out of a fight or to carry one
      through.</p>
    <p>The progress of the four would-be bullies in
      their fireside travels, and their swaggering education,
      was accompanied by further improvement in the
      dress of their instructors. At last the soldier and
      his friend were able to go clad in breeches, stockings,
      shoes, shirts, ruffs, and gloves, quite worthy of the
      cloaks, doublets, and hats they had previously received.
      The four young gentlemen were now eager
      to try their new accomplishments about the town.
      The captain postponed the test as long as he could;
      but finally their impatience was so peremptory that
      he had to consent.</p>
    <p>Now the captain knew that if his four apes should
      make a failure of their first attempt at swaggering,
      his favour with them were swiftly ruined; conversely,
      a success would warrant his demanding a substantial
      reward in money. Thus far his only payment, and
      Master Holyday's likewise, had been in the shape of
      dinners, suppers, tobacco, and clothes. The two had<span class="pagenum"><a
          id="Page_88" name="Page_88">[88]</a></span>
      been compelled, from time to time, to put off payment
      for their lodgings, and to temporise with their
      laundress; and now their hostess's face wore a more
      and more inquiring look each morning as they went
      out. Ravenshaw had, it was true, obtained a little
      coin in the card-playing and dicing, by means of
      which he had illustrated to his pupils the uses of
      roaring in those pastimes. But this amount, small
      enough, he decided to lay out in ensuring the desired
      success of his coxcombs in their first bullying
      exhibition.</p>
    <p>He therefore made a sudden and secret excursion
      to the suburbs beyond Newgate. After searching
      the lower taverns and ale-houses about Holborn and
      Smithfield, he found, in a cookshop in Pye Corner,
      a man with whom he forthwith entered into negotiation.
      This man was a burly, middle-aged fellow,
      with a broken nose, a scarred cheek, a sullen attitude,
      and a husky voice. While he talked, he frequently
      spat in the rushes that covered the floor; and now
      and again he would finish a remark with the words,
      added without the least sense, "And that's the hell
      of it." He wore a dirty leather jerkin over other
      clothes, and his attire was little better than Ravenshaw's
      had been before his change of fortune.</p>
    <p>After some talk, Captain Ravenshaw handed over
      some money to this man, promised a further sum
      upon the issue of the business, received the bravo's<span class="pagenum"><a
          id="Page_89" name="Page_89">[89]</a></span>
      assurance that all should go well, and hastened
      back alone to meet his companions at the sign of
      the Windmill.</p>
    <p>It was evening when the party sallied forth, the
      four coxcombs as keen for riot as ever was a colt for
      kicking up heels in a field. They would have barred
      the street against the first comers, or sought a brawl
      in the first tavern, but that Ravenshaw bade them
      save their mettle for adversaries worthy of their
      schooling.</p>
    <p>"I mean to pit ye 'gainst the first roarers of the
      suburbs," said he. "Nothing short of the kings of
      Turnbull Street shall suffice ye, lads. What think
      ye of Cutting Tom himself? I know where he and
      his comrades take their supper nowadays. Save
      your breath for such; an ye roar them down in
      their own haunts, it shall be heard of. Waste no
      wind upon citizens or spruce gallants. Strike high,
      win supremacy at the first trial, and you are made
      men."</p>
    <p>With such counsel he restrained them until he had
      led them through Smithfield to Cow Cross, near the
      town's edge.</p>
    <p>Like a bent arm, lying northwestward along the
      fields toward Clerkenwell, was the narrow lane of
      ramshackle houses called Turnbull Street. Leaving
      his followers, the captain went into one of these
      houses. He soon came back.</p>
    <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span></p>
    <p>"'Tis excellent," said he. "Cutting Tom and his
      friends are in the front room at the top o' the stairs.
      They are feasting it with the hostess and some of
      her gossips. You four shall go up and claim the
      room by right of superior quality. Master Holyday
      and I will stay below in talk with the bar-boy so
      they sha'n't know I'm with you; but if need be, call
      me."</p>
    <p>"Nay, we shall want no help," said Master Maylands;
      but the quaver of his voice belied his show
      of confidence.</p>
    <p>"'Tis well," replied Ravenshaw. "A rare thing
      to roar these braggarts from their own table, before
      the womankind of their own acquaintance! Come."</p>
    <p>A minute later the four sparks, huddled close together,
      and with white faces, thrust themselves into
      an ill-plastered room where four villainous-looking
      fellows and as many painted women sat at table.
      These people suddenly ceased their loud talk and
      coarse laughter, and one of them,&#8212;the broken-nosed
      rascal with whom Ravenshaw had that day conversed
      in the cook-shop&#8212;demanded thunderously:</p>
    <p>"Death and furies! Who the devil be these?"</p>
    <p>"Your betters, bottle-ale rogue!" cried Maylands,
      somewhat shrilly, and like an actor in a play.</p>
    <p>"Betters!" bellowed the broken-nosed man, rising
      to his feet. "Plagues, curses, and damnations!
      Does the dog live that says 'betters' to me? I am<span class="pagenum"><a
          id="Page_91" name="Page_91">[91]</a></span>
      called Cutting Tom, thou bubble!&#8212;Cutting Tom,
      and that's the hell of it!"</p>
    <p>"An you be called Cutting Tom," replied Maylands,
      taking a little courage from the sound of his
      own voice, "'tis plain you are called so for the cuts
      you have received, not given. The wounds in your
      dirty face come not from war, but from bottles
      thrown by hostesses you've cheated. Out of this
      room, dog-face!&#8212;you and your scurvy crew.
      'Twould take a forest of juniper to sweeten the place
      while you're in it. You are not fit for the presence
      of such handsome ladies."</p>
    <p>"A gentleman of spirit," whispered one of the
      ladies, audibly.</p>
    <p>"What, thou froth, thou vapour, thou fume!"
      roared Cutting Tom. "Avaunt! ere I stick you
      with my dagger and hang you up by the love-lock at
      a butcher's stall for veal."</p>
    <p>"Hence, thou slave," retorted Maylands, "thou
      pick-purse, thou horse-stealer, thou contamination,
      thou conglomeration of all plagues&#8212;!"</p>
    <p>"Thou bundle of refuse!" put in Master Hawes.</p>
    <p>"Thou heap of mud!" added Master Dauncey.</p>
    <p>"Thou filth out of the street-ditch!" cried Master
      Clarington.</p>
    <p>Meanwhile the women had scampered to the fireplace
      for safety. Cutting Tom's three comrades had
      found their feet, and they now joined their voices to<span class="pagenum"><a
          id="Page_92" name="Page_92">[92]</a></span>
      his in a chorus of abuse, defiance, and threat;
      they beat the table fearsomely with their sheathed
      swords. In turn, the young gentlemen half-drew
      their blades and then pushed them violently back
      again, and trod angrily upon the rushes. Cutting
      Tom's party had all got to that side of the table
      farther from the door. The four intruders therefore
      advanced to the table, and with terrible words belaboured
      their adversaries across it.</p>
    <p>"A step more," cried Cutting Tom, banging his
      sword handle upon the table, "and I'll spit ye!"</p>
    <p>"And roast ye after at the fire!" said one of his
      men.</p>
    <p>The gallants showed that they could rattle their
      hilts upon the innocent board as fiercely.</p>
    <p>"Out of the room," shouted Maylands, "ere we
      pin ye to the wall and set dogs on ye!"</p>
    <p>This was but the beginning of the contest, which
      soon attained a scurrility too shocking, not for Elizabethan
      ears, but for these pages. Meanwhile, Ravenshaw
      and Holyday waited below. At last a noise
      was heard in the passage above, and the four ill-favoured
      fellows came bounding down the stairs.
      Three of them left the house at once, but Cutting
      Tom, seeing that the gallants did not follow, stopped
      to whisper with the captain.</p>
    <p>"'Twas good as a play," quoth he. "We held our
      own awhile, as you bade. Then we let 'em overbear<span class="pagenum"><a
          id="Page_93" name="Page_93">[93]</a></span>
      us, and at last we feigned such fear they said they'd
      e'en make us tie their shoes. 'They're tied already,'
      quoth I. 'Then untie 'em,' said they. We untied
      'em; and then they'd have us depart a-crawling on
      our hands and knees; and so we left 'em, on all
      fours; and that's the hell of it! I thought the
      women would have burst a-laughing."</p>
    <p>"Here's the rest of the money," said Ravenshaw,
      parting with his last coin. "Now vanish, and come
      not here again this night, or you'll have me to
      answer!"</p>
    <p>Cutting Tom examined the money by the candle-light,
      and went his way with a grunt.</p>
    <p>"So far, good," said Ravenshaw, chuckling. "Our
      young cocks will think themselves the prime swaggerers
      of Christendom."</p>
    <p>"Until they come upon the truth," said Holyday.
      "The next men they meet, they'll be for bullying;
      and then they're not like to come off as well."</p>
    <p>"But they shall meet no men this night. The
      ladies above will keep 'em here till they be too sleepy
      with wine for any desire of roaring. We'll see 'em
      safe home, and to-morrow at dinner I'll ply 'em for a
      fat remuneration. When that's in our pockets, they
      may learn the truth and go hang. We'll hire a page
      to attend us, and we'll live like gentlemen. We're
      lucky to have found 'em constant so long. Come;
      we'll up to them, as if we happened in."</p>
    <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span></p>
    <p>"Nay, not I, where there be women."</p>
    <p>"Oh, plague, man, you'll not be long bashful afore
      these trollops!" And he pulled the unwilling scholar
      after him by the arm.</p>

    <p>The next day, after dinner, finding the four dupes
      as much puffed up with imagined valour as he had
      hoped, Ravenshaw put forward the matter of a fit
      reward. That they might more freely consider, he
      left them for half an hour, taking Holyday with
      him.</p>
    <p>"Troth," began Master Hawes, when the four
      were alone, "I think we have bestowed somewhat already
      upon these two. If they are pressed for money,
      why don't they pawn some of the clothes we've given
      'em?"</p>
    <p>"They consider they must be well clad to go in
      our company," said Clarington.</p>
    <p>"If it comes to that," said Maylands, "we can
      dispense with 'em. We roared down this Cutting
      Tom and his Turnbull rangers, why should we be
      still beholden to this captain?"</p>
    <p>"And we've learned as much of t'other one's
      travels as we're like to remember," added Dauncey.</p>
    <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span></p>
    <p>"Let them go hang for any more gifts!" said
      Maylands.</p>
    <p>"Will you tell them so?" queried Hawes.</p>
    <p>"Faith, yes! An we can roar down four Turnbull
      rangers, can we not roar down this one captain?
      He has taught us all he knows himself."</p>
    <p>"Yet I would not have him think us stingy," said
      Hawes, who, as he was stingy, was sensitive as to
      being thought so.</p>
    <p>"Why, look you," replied Maylands. "When they
      come back, I'll say we'll satisfy 'em, touching a gift
      of money, ere the day be done. Then, presently,
      we'll find some occasion in their talk for a quarrel.
      Thereupon, we'll roar 'em down, and so break with
      'em."</p>
    <p>The occasion arrived when Master Holyday was in
      the midst of a wonderfully imagined tale of travel.
      He told how he had escaped from Barbary pirates in
      the Mediterranean, and swum ashore to the harbour
      of&#8212;Fez!</p>
    <p>"What, man?" broke in Master Clarington.
      "Fez is not on the seacoast."</p>
    <p>"Most certainly it is," said the scholar, imperturbably.</p>
    <p>"'Tis not. I had an uncle, a merchant adventurer,
      was there once. He had to journey far
      inland."</p>
    <p>"Oh, ay," said Holyday, a little staggered; "the<span class="pagenum"><a
          id="Page_97" name="Page_97">[97]</a></span>
      city of Fez is inland, but the country borders on
      the sea. 'Twas that I meant."</p>
    <p>"Nay, you spoke of the harbour; you must have
      meant the city."</p>
    <p>"Tush, tush!" put in Ravenshaw, anxious to keep
      up the scholar's credit. "He meant the country;
      a fool could see that."</p>
    <p>"Ay, truly," said Master Maylands, "a fool; but
      none else."</p>
    <p>"I'll thank you for better manners," said Ravenshaw,
      sharply.</p>
    <p>"Manners, thou braggart!" cried Maylands, seizing
      his opportunity. "Thou sponge, thou receptacle
      of cast clothing! Talk you of manners?"</p>
    <p>"What!&#8212;what!&#8212;what!&#8212;what!" was all the
      answer the amazed captain could make for the
      moment.</p>
    <p>"Ay, manners, thou base, scurvy knave; thou
      houseless parasite, thou resuscitated starveling!&#8212;thou
      and thy hungry scholar!" put in Master Hawes.</p>
    <p>"Oho! 'Tis thus? Ye think to try my swaggering
      lessons against me?" said the captain, springing
      to his feet.</p>
    <p>"Pish! You are no better than Cutting Tom,"
      retorted Maylands.</p>
    <p>Ravenshaw's wrath knew no bounds. The four
      rebellious pupils and providers were on their feet,
      defiant and impudent.</p>
    <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span></p>
    <p>"You'd raise your weak breath against me, would
      ye? And you'd finger your sword-hilts, would ye?"
      he roared. "By this hand, ye shall draw them, too!
      Draw, and fend your numbskulls 'gainst the whacks
      I'll give 'em! Draw, and save your puny shoulders!
      I scorn to use good steel against ye, dunces, lispers,
      puppies! I'll rout ye with a spit!"</p>
    <p>They had drawn swords at his word, thinking he
      would wield his rapier against them. But, as it was,
      they had an ill time enough to defend themselves
      against the spit he had seized from the fireplace.
      Nimbly he knocked aside their blades, violently he
      charged among them, swiftly he laid about him on
      pates and bodies; so that in small time they fled,
      appalled and panic-stricken, not only from the room,
      but down the stairs. The captain did not take the
      trouble to follow them beyond the doorsill of the
      room.</p>
    <p>"Hang them, bubbles!" quoth he. "They shall
      come on their knees and lick my shoes, ere I'll take
      'em back to favour again."</p>
    <p>But the scholar philosophically shrugged his
      shoulders.</p>
    <p>To make matters worse, as the two were about to
      leave the tavern, they were called upon to pay the
      score. Ravenshaw said the young gentlemen would
      pay, as usual.</p>
    <p>"Nay," said the hostess, "they went away cursing<span class="pagenum"><a
          id="Page_99" name="Page_99">[99]</a></span>
      my tavern, and saying they would never come near
      it again. 'Twas you ordered, and I look to you to
      pay. 'Tis bad enough an you drive good customers
      from my house, and give it a bad name with your
      swaggering."</p>
    <p>"Peace, peace, sweetheart. We have no money
      to pay; there's not a groat between us."</p>
    <p>"Then you have clothes to pawn. I'll have my
      money, or I'll enter an action. So look to't, or, by
      this light, ye'll find yourselves in prison, I swear
      to ye!"</p>
    <p>The two unfortunates fled from her tongue, down
      the Old Jewry. It rains not but it pours; and when
      they reached their lodgings in St. Lawrence Lane
      they were confronted by the woman of the house,
      whose distrust had been brought to a head by their
      absence the previous night. She must have her
      money; let them go less bravely clad, and pay their
      honest debts, else they had best beware of sheriff's
      officers.</p>
    <p>When they were alone in their room, Holyday was
      for selling their fine clothes.</p>
    <p>"Never, never!" said Ravenshaw. "If we cannot
      make our fortunes in fine clothes, how shall we do it
      in rags? Though we go penniless, while we look
      gallant we shall be relied upon. Some enterprise
      will fall our way."</p>
    <p>The next morning they rose before their hostess,<span class="pagenum"><a
          id="Page_100" name="Page_100">[100]</a></span>
      and took leave of her house without troubling her
      with farewells. They found new quarters in a shoemaker's
      house in St. Martin's-le-Grand, and avoided
      their old haunts for fear of arrest.</p>
    <p>The question of meals now grew difficult. Ravenshaw
      had become so well known that possible
      adversaries at the gaming-tables shunned him. What
      little credit he could still compass at ordinaries and
      taverns soon prepared the way for new threats
      of arrest. Sometimes the two companions contrived
      to eat once a day, sometimes once in two days.
      After a time, the captain agreed that Holyday might
      barter his clothes. The scholar speedily appeared
      in a suit of modest black, as if he were his gallant
      companion's secretary; and for awhile the two
      feasted daily. But anon they were penniless again,
      and went hungry. The captain swore he would not
      part with his fine raiment; though he should starve,
      it would be as a swaggering gallant still.</p>
    <p>No Lent was ever better kept than was the latter
      part of that year's Lent (though to no profit of the
      fishmongers) by those two undone men. Their
      cheeks became hollow, their bellies sank inward,
      they could feel their ribs when they passed their
      hands over their chests. They went feverish and
      gaunt, with parched mouths and griped stomachs.
      As hunger gnawed him, and the fear of sheriff's
      officers beset him at every corner, and hope grew<span class="pagenum"><a
          id="Page_101" name="Page_101">[101]</a></span>
      feeble within him, the captain became subject to
      alternations of grim resignation and futile rage.
      The scholar starved with serenity, as became a
      master of the liberal arts, being visited in his sleep
      by dreams of glorious banquets, upon which in his
      waking hours he made sonnets.</p>
    <p>In May the patience of the shoemaker in St. Martin's-le-Grand
      was exhausted, and the two penniless
      men had other lodgings to seek.</p>
    <p>They spent much of their time now in St. Paul's
      Church. Here employment was like to offer, and
      here was comparative safety from arrest, certain parts
      of the church being held sanctuary for debtors. To
      St. Paul's, therefore, they went on the morning that
      found them again roofless; keeping a lookout on the
      way thither for any sheriff's men who might with
      warrant be in quest of them. It was fortunate that
      none waylaid them, for the captain was in such
      mood that he would have gone near slaying any that
      had. Neither he nor Holyday had eaten for two
      days.</p>
    <p>They took their station against a pillar in the middle
      aisle of the great church, and watched with sharp
      eyes the many-coloured crowd of men, of every grade
      from silken gallants to burden-bearing porters, that
      passed up and down before them, making a ceaseless
      noise of footfalls and voices, and sometimes giving
      the pair scant room for their famished bodies.</p>
    <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span></p>
    <p>The St. Paul's of that time was larger than the
      present cathedral. It covered three and a half acres,
      and was proportionately lofty. Thanks to its great
      doors and wide aisles, it afforded a short way through
      for those foot-goers in whose route it lay,&#8212;porters,
      labourers, and citizens going about their business.
      But its wide aisles served better still as a covered
      lounging-place for those on whose hands time hung
      heavy,&#8212;gentlemen of fashion, men who lived by
      their wits, fellows who sought service, and the like.
      These were the true "Paul's walkers." It was a
      meeting-place, too, for those who had miscellaneous
      business to transact; a great resort for the exchange
      of news, in a day when newspapers did not exist.
      Certain of the huge pillars supporting the groined
      arches of the roof were used to post advertising bills
      upon. The services, in which a very fine organ and
      other instruments were employed, were usually held
      in the choir only, and the crowd in the nave and
      transepts did not much disturb itself on account of
      them. The time of most resort was the hour before
      the midday dinner; and it was then that Ravenshaw
      and Holyday took their stand before the pillar on
      this May morning.</p>
    <p>"There walks a poet that hath found a patron,"
      said the scholar. "Yet 'tis ten to one the verses he
      is showing are no better than these sonnets in my
      breeches pocket here."</p>
    <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span></p>
    <p>"If you had a capon's leg or two in your breeches
      pocket it were more to the purpose," replied the
      captain.</p>
    <p>"'Troth, my sonnets are full of capon's legs and
      all other things good to eat," sighed Holyday. "I've
      conceived rare dishes lately; I have writ of nothing
      else."</p>
    <p>"If we could but eat the dishes out of thy sonnets!"
      muttered Ravenshaw. "How can you write
      sonnets while you are hungry?"</p>
    <p>"Why, your born poet finds discomfort a spur.
      There was the prophet Jonas writ a sonnet in the
      whale's belly."</p>
    <p>"Faith, I'd rather undertake to write one with a
      whale in my belly! I feel room for a whale there.
      Who the devil comes here?"</p>
    <p>It was none other than Master Maylands, and following
      him were Clarington, Dauncey, and Hawes,
      the four being attended by a footman and a page.
      These gallants, in coming down the aisle, had espied
      the captain before he had seen them. They had
      stopped and held a brief colloquy.</p>
    <p>"Pish! who's afeard?" Maylands had said. "He
      won't fight in the church."</p>
    <p>"And if he will," said Clarington, "we can 'scape
      in the crowd."</p>
    <p>"Hang him, hedgehog!" said Dauncey. "I think
      the spirit has gone out of him, by his looks."</p>
    <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span></p>
    <p>"It makes me boil," said Hawes, "to see the
      dog dressed out like a gentleman in clothes of our
      giving."</p>
    <p>The gallants advanced, therefore, looking as supercilious
      and impudent as they could.</p>
    <p>"God save you, dog of war!" said Maylands.</p>
    <p>"God lose you, pup of peace!" replied the captain.</p>
    <p>"Faith, I had thought 'twas a warm day," said
      Maylands, "but for seeing you wear a heavy cloak.
      Or is it that you durs'n't leave it home, lest it be
      seized in pawn for debt?"</p>
    <p>"You are merry," quoth the captain, briefly; for
      the gallant had mentioned the true reason.</p>
    <p>"It shows your regard for us," put in Hawes,
      "that you always wear our clothes, to avoid their
      being seized."</p>
    <p>"A finger-snap for your clothes!" said the captain,
      his ire engendered by their daring to make so free of
      speech with him.</p>
    <p>"Nay, you value 'em more than that," said Clarington.
      "They're all you have."</p>
    <p>"Is it so?" said the captain.</p>
    <p>"Ay," said Maylands, "you must needs wear our
      livery still, whether you will or no."</p>
    <p>"Your livery, curse ye!" cried Ravenshaw, observing
      that some in the crowd had halted to see
      what game of banter was going on. "Why, monkeys,
      I've worn these clothes about the town in hope<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_105"
          name="Page_105">[105]</a></span>
      of meeting ye, that I might give 'em back. Since
      I did ye the honour to take your gifts, I've heard
      things of ye that make it a shame to have known ye.
      I've sought ye everywhere; but the fear of a beating
      has kept ye indoors. Now that I meet ye, for God's
      sake take back your gifts, and clear me of all beholding
      to such vermin! Your cloak, say you? Yes,
      lap-dog, there's for you. I thank God I'm free of
      it!" Acting on the impulse which had come with
      the inspiration for his retort, and wrought up beyond
      all thought of expediency, he had flung the cloak in
      the astonished gallant's face. "This bonnet will better
      fit an empty head," and he tossed his cap to
      Clarington. "Here's a doublet, too; I've long ached
      to be rid of it," he cried, divesting himself of that
      garment as fast as he could, to hurl it at the head
      of Master Hawes. "This ruff has choked me of
      late; I pray you, hang yourself with it; there'll be
      an ass the less. The shoes are yours, coney; take
      'em, and walk to hell in 'em!" He threw them one
      after another at their former owner, and began drawing
      off his stockings. "I'll be more careful in accepting
      gifts hereafter; a gift is a tie, and a man should
      make no tie with those he may come to hear foul reports
      of. Your stockings, sir! The breeches,&#8212;nay,
      I must take them off at home, and send 'em to you
      later; them and the shirt, and sundry linen and such,
      that are with the laundress. Take these gloves,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_106"
          name="Page_106">[106]</a></span>
      though, and this handkerchief; and you your hanger
      and scabbard, and the rest. Take 'em, I bid ye,
      or&#8212;And now, whelps, you've got what's yours.
      Thank God, the sword and dagger are my own! My
      weapons may go naked while my body does. Vanish,
      with your gifts! I scorn ye!"</p>
    <p>His voice and looks were such that the four gentlemen
      thought best to obey. Hastily entrusting the
      captain's cast raiment to the footman and page, who
      closely followed them, they pushed through the grinning
      crowd that had witnessed the scene; and the
      captain was left in his shirt and breeches, with his
      sword and dagger in his hands, to the amused gaze
      of the assembly, and the somewhat rueful contemplation
      of Master Holyday.</p>

    <p>Among newcomers who at that moment pressed
      forward to see what was the matter, were Master
      Jerningham and Sir Clement Ermsby. Followed by
      Gregory and the page, they had but then entered
      the church upon the quest we know of. By standing
      upon their toes, they got a view of the half-naked
      man. At the same time they heard the name,
      "Roaring Ravenshaw," passed about.</p>
    <p>"Ravenshaw?" said Ermsby to his friend. "So
      'tis. And your very man."</p>
    <p>"What, for such an affair? A swaggering cast
      soldier?"</p>
    <p>"Ay, indeed. The last man in the world to be
      suspected in your particular case."</p>
    <p>"But can he compass it?"</p>
    <p>"Trust these brawlers, these livers by their wits,
      for a thousand shifts. They get their bread by
      tricks."</p>
    <p>"But will he undertake it?"</p>
    <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span></p>
    <p>"For pay? Look at him."</p>
    <p>"But he was her champion that night."</p>
    <p>"A mere show, to cross us. Should they know
      each other again, 'twill gain him her confidence the
      sooner. Go; make use of his present need."</p>
    <p>"Shall you come with me?"</p>
    <p>"He might remember me as his adversary that

      you. Better he shouldn't know you are my friend.
      I'll be gone, ere he see us together. Meet me at
      Horn's ordinary when you have done with him. To
      him straight."</p>
    <p>Beckoning his page, Sir Clement hastened from
      the church, while Jerningham, with Gregory at his
      heels, elbowed imperiously forward till he was face
      to face with the captain. Ravenshaw had, in the
      meantime, been bandying jests with the crowd,
      though inwardly wondering what he should do
      next.</p>
    <p>"When a soldier of your ability comes to this
      plight," said Jerningham, in a courteous, kindly tone,
      "'tis plain the fault's not so much his own as it is
      the world's."</p>
    <p>Ravenshaw gazed at the speaker; manifestly
      without recognition.</p>
    <p>"Sir," said the captain, "whatever faults the world
      hath done me, I dare yet put my dagger to the
      world's throat, and cry 'Deliver!'"</p>
    <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span></p>
    <p>"Still the swaggerer," quoth Jerningham, with
      his soft smile.</p>
    <p>"Ever the swaggerer," replied Ravenshaw. "'Tis
      my policy. This craven world will give nothing out
      of love or pity; 'twill give only out of fear; and so
      I bully out of it a living."</p>
    <p>Jerningham went close to him, and spoke in
      tones not to be heard by the crowd, which presently,
      seeing that no more amusement was to
      be afforded, began to melt into the usual stream
      of saunterers.</p>
    <p>"I take it," said Jerningham, "you are as good at
      cozening as at bullying."</p>
    <p>"I am not such a coward as to deny it. There be
      some so tame, the fiend couldn't find it in his heart
      to bully them; at the same time, their lack of wit
      must needs tempt me to cozen them."</p>
    <p>"You have a persuasive speech at will, too, I see."</p>
    <p>"Seest thou?"</p>
    <p>"Look you: I could mend your fortunes if you
      could persuade, or cozen, or bully, to a certain end
      for me."</p>
    <p>"Prove you'll mend my fortunes, and I'm your
      man," said the captain, jumping at the hope.</p>
    <p>Jerningham regarded him for a moment thoughtfully,
      then said:</p>
    <p>"Perhaps I'd best prove it first, ere I tell you
      what service I require."</p>
    <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span></p>
    <p>"I care not what the service is. Anything that a
      man can do, I can do."</p>
    <p>"And will do?"</p>
    <p>"And will do&#8212;if it be not too black. I'll not
      murder."</p>
    <p>"Oh, the business has no murder in it. Here's
      proof I'll mend your fortune&#8212;all such proof that
      is in my purse, as you see. Meet me here after
      dinner, dressed so as not to draw everybody's eyes
      upon us as we talk. You shall hear then what the
      service is. And there shall be more pay when it is
      done."</p>
    <p>The captain took the money with unconcealed
      avidity, betraying his feelings by the readiness with
      which he promised good faith and promptitude.
      Seizing Holyday's arm, he then hastened off to
      Smithfield, reckless alike of the appearance he made
      in the streets, and of the risk of meeting sergeants.
      In the second-hand shops of Long Lane he remedied
      his nakedness at a price which left sufficient for his
      dinner and the scholar's at Mother Walker's three-halfpenny
      ordinary. When he reappeared in St.
      Paul's, which was now comparatively empty between
      hours of resort, he wore a suit of faded maroon with
      orange-tawny stockings and a brown felt hat.</p>
    <p>Meanwhile, Jerningham, glad to have committed
      the swaggerer to the business before the latter knew
      its nature, had told the news to Sir Clement at<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_111"
          name="Page_111">[111]</a></span>
      dinner, and was already back in the church. The
      faithful Gregory still attended him, more disgruntled
      than ever, for he considered that he might have had
      some of the money his master had bestowed, and
      would yet bestow, upon this swaggering captain.
      Gregory regarded the captain blackly; he viewed
      this new engagement as a thing most unnecessary,
      most injurious to himself; and he found his wrath
      increase each time he looked upon the interloper.
      Jerningham bade him wait out of hearing, and
      beckoned the captain into a darkish corner of the
      church, whither Master Holyday did not follow.</p>
    <p>"Well," said Ravenshaw, with after-dinner joviality,
      "what's the business? What is it you would
      have me bully, or cozen, or persuade for you?"</p>
    <p>"In plain words, a certain wench's consent to
      a meeting," was the reply.</p>
    <p>"What the devil!" cried the captain, aflame.
      "Do you take me for a ring-carrier?"</p>
    <p>Jerningham was silent a moment; then said:</p>
    <p>"I take you for no better&#8212;and no worse&#8212;than
      any disbanded soldier that lives upon his wits about
      the town here."</p>
    <p>"What others do, is not for me to be judged by.
      I am Ravenshaw."</p>
    <p>"I never heard any reason why Ravenshaw should
      be thought more tender of women than his comrades
      are."</p>
    <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span></p>
    <p>"Tender of women! A plague on 'em! I owe
      them nothing but injuries. 'Tis not that."</p>
    <p>"What is it, then, offends you?"</p>
    <p>"'Tis that you should think me a scurvy fellow that
      you dare affront with the offer of such an errand."</p>
    <p>"Why, 'tis no scurvy errand. I only ask you to
      persuade her to meet me. I would approach her myself,
      but I am suspected and cannot come at her
      without her connivance. I need one whom her people
      have not marked, to speak to her for me. I take
      it you have the wit to reach her ear. I would have
      you carry her my praises, and vows, and solicitations
      for a meeting; and describe me to her as you see
      me, as a liberal, well-inclined gentleman."</p>
    <p>"Ay, in short, you ask me to play the go-between."</p>
    <p>"Oh, pshaw, man! stumble not at mere names."</p>
    <p>"The names for such business are none too
      sweet, in troth!"</p>
    <p>"They are but names. And sweet names may be
      coined for it. Love's ambassador, Cupid's orator,
      heart's emissary,&#8212;call yourself so, and the business
      becomes honourable."</p>
    <p>"Faith, I have long known things are odious or
      honourable in accordance with the names they're
      called by. But I am not for your business."</p>
    <p>"Why, you have no choice. You are bound to it
      by the clothes you wear, bought with my money&#8212;"</p>
    <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span></p>
    <p>"I can e'en doff these clothes, as I have doffed
      others," said the captain, though somewhat disconsolately.</p>
    <p>"By the very dinner you have eaten," went on
      Jerningham.</p>
    <p>"I can scratch up the money to pay you for that."</p>
    <p>"And by the further service I intend for you.
      Beshrew me, man, you may find yourself nested for
      life if you keep my favour. No more nakedness and
      starvation." Jerningham, on the eve of his long
      voyage, could afford any promise; besides, 'twas
      not impossible this redoubtable fellow might really
      be useful to him indefinitely, one way or another.</p>
    <p>Ravenshaw glared at him with the tortured look
      of a man sorely tempted.</p>
    <p>"Moreover," added Jerningham, "what profit can
      you have in any kind of virtue, when your reputation
      is so villainous?"</p>
    <p>"Hang my reputation! I'll not be taken for a
      love-messenger. I'll help no man to any woman."</p>
    <p>"You are an ass, then. For aught you know, my
      love may be honest enough."</p>
    <p>"If it were, you would go about it otherwise."</p>
    <p>"You know not the world, to say so. Does
      honest love always work openly? Hath not every
      case its peculiar circumstances? Because you fear,
      without known grounds, that you may be a means of
      harm to a wench, will you go hungry to-morrow?<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_114"
          name="Page_114">[114]</a></span>
      You are fed now, but will you be fed then? Troth,
      I ne'er knew a craving stomach to have nice
      scruples."</p>
    <p>"Oh, faith, I know that want is an evil counsellor."</p>
    <p>"Evil or not, it speaks so loud as to silence all
      others. Is it not so? Come, captain, be not a fool.
      If I mean no harm to the girl, 'tis no harm in your
      bringing us together."</p>
    <p>"But if you do mean harm?"</p>
    <p>"Can I do her harm against her will? She shall
      name the place and time of meeting. Is it for grown
      men to be qualmish merely because a petticoat is
      concerned?"</p>
    <p>"Petticoats to the devil! I owe no kindness to
      women, I say. 'Twas a woman's wiles upon my
      father robbed me of my patrimony. 'Twas a
      woman's treason to my love poisoned my heart,
      deprived me of my friend, changed the course of my
      fortunes, and made me what I am. Calamities fall
      upon the whole she-tribe, say I!"</p>
    <p>"Why, then, if at the worst chance I should be
      the cause of harm to this one, 'twould be so much
      amends to you on the part of the sex."</p>
    <p>A sudden baleful light gleamed in Ravenshaw's eyes.</p>
    <p>"By God, that were some revenge!" he muttered.
      "Who is the woman?"</p>
    <p>"A goldsmith's daughter, in Cheapside."</p>
    <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span></p>
    <p>"A goldsmith's daughter&#8212;some vain minx, no
      doubt; deserving no better fate, and desiring no
      better. As for the goldsmith&#8212;they are cheaters
      all, these citizens that keep shops; overchargers,
      falsifiers of accounts; they rob by ways that are
      most despicable because least dangerous. And they
      call <i>me</i> knave! And their women, that flaunt in
      silks and jewels bought with their cheatings&#8212;'twas
      such a woman cozened me! 'Twas such that made
      a rogue of me; if I were e'en to pay back my
      roguery upon such!&#8212;I'll do it! By my faith, I'll
      do it! I'll be your knave in this, your rascal; I
      take it, a knave is better than a starveling, a rascal
      is choicer company than a famished man. And 'tis
      time I settled scores with the race of wenches!
      Let's hear the full business."</p>
    <p>Jerningham set forth exactly the situation. He
      laid stress on his requirement that the meeting
      should occur within the next two days. But he
      said nothing of the projected voyage; nor did he
      mention the circumstances in which he had first seen
      the girl. When he told her name and abode, he
      looked for any possible sign of recognition on the
      captain's part. But none came; Ravenshaw had
      never learned who was the heroine of that February
      night's incident.</p>
    <p>When Jerningham took his departure, the captain
      strode over to where Holyday awaited him.</p>
    <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span></p>
    <p>"Rogue's work," said Ravenshaw; "but a rogue
      am I, and there's an end. I must get access to a
      rich man's house, and to the private ear of a wench;
      and move her to meet secretly a gentleman she
      knows not; and all within two days. How is it to
      be done?"</p>
    <p>"Is the rich man a gentleman&#8212;of the true gentry,
      I mean&#8212;or is he a citizen here, a man of trade?"
      queried Holyday. "If a man of trade, the way to
      his house, or his anything, is to make him think
      there's money to be got out of you."</p>
    <p>"He is a goldsmith in Cheapside."</p>
    <p>"Why, then, let me see. There is a goldsmith
      lives there, somewhere, knows my father. They
      were friends together in their youth, in Kent. I
      haven't met him since I was a small lad; but I
      might go to him as straight from my father; and
      then introduce you as a country gentleman; and so
      he might be got to commend you to the goldsmith
      you seek."</p>
    <p>"There's no time for roundabout ways. Yet your
      father's friend may serve us one way or another.
      What's his name?"</p>
    <p>"Thomas Etheridge. As I remember, my
      father&#8212;"</p>
    <p>"What? Why, death of my life! 'tis my very
      goldsmith; the one whose daughter I must have
      speech with. Faith, here's a miracle to help us&#8212;<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_117"
          name="Page_117">[117]</a></span>
      of the devil's working, no doubt. This Etheridge
      knows not you are at odds with your father?"</p>
    <p>"'Tis hardly possible he should. I have never
      sought him since I came to town. He never would
      go back to Kent, and so he could not see my father.
      He has an elder brother lives near my father; but
      'twixt that brother and the goldsmith there was an
      old quarrel, which kept the goldsmith from coming
      to visit our part of the country; 'twould keep the
      brothers from communicating, as well."</p>
    <p>"Have you means of assuring him you are your
      father's son? Can he doubt?"</p>
    <p>"He would believe me for my likeness to my
      mother. He knew her."</p>
    <p>"Then you shall carry him your father's good
      words this hour; and you shall commend me to
      him as&#8212;but I must change my looks first. I'll
      to the barber's, and cast my beard, all but a small
      wit-tuft under the lip; and have my moustaches
      pointed toward the sky. This goldsmith may have
      seen Roaring Ravenshaw in his time; I'll be another
      man then."</p>
    <p>"But the daughter&#8212;it must be managed so I
      shall not have to meet her&#8212;or any women o' the
      family."</p>
    <p>"Oh, the devil, man! if you be not introduced to
      the ladies, how shall your mere friend be? But stay;
      at best, will the friend be? These citizens are wary<span class="pagenum"><a
          id="Page_118" name="Page_118">[118]</a></span>
      with their hospitality. The son of your father might
      be invited to the table, the son's friend bowed out
      with a cool 'God be wi' ye, sir!' 'Tis all too roundabout
      still. Body o' Jupiter, I have it! He hath not
      seen you since you were a lad, say you?"</p>
    <p>"Not since a day my water-spaniel bit him in the
      calf o' the leg, the last time he came to see my father.
      I was twelve years old or so."</p>
    <p>"Good. I shall remember the water-spaniel; and
      as we go to the barber's, you shall tell me other
      things I may recall to his mind; things none but
      you and your father could have known."</p>
    <p>"Certainly; but how shall these serve you?"</p>
    <p>"Why, I have neither letters nor likeness, to bear
      out my word. But the barber shall make me look
      the right age; and these old remembrances, with
      some further knowledge of matters at your home, and
      my assurance,&#8212;all these shall make me pass with
      Master Etheridge as Ralph Holyday, son of his old
      friend; and you need take no hand in the business&#8212;that
      is, if you'll allow this."</p>
    <p>"With all my heart," said Holyday, glad to escape
      the risk of meeting women.</p>

    <div class="center">MISTRESS MILLICENT.</div>

      <blockquote><p>"'Tis a pretty wench, a very pretty wench,&#8212;nay, a very, very, very pretty
      wench."<br />
      &#8212;<i>The Wise-woman of Hogsdon.</i><br /></p></blockquote>

    <p>The house of Thomas Etheridge, goldsmith, was
      near facing the great gilt cross in Cheapside, the
      images around whose base&#8212;especially that of the
      Virgin&#8212;were chronically in a state of more or less
      defacement. A few doors east of Master Etheridge's,
      and directly opposite the cross, was the
      western end of Goldsmith's Row, described by Stow
      as "the most beautiful frame of fair houses and shops
      that be within the walls of London, or elsewhere in
      England." It consisted of "ten fair dwelling-houses
      and fourteen shops, all in one frame, uniformly built
      four stories high, beautified toward the street with
      the Goldsmiths' arms and the likeness of woodmen,
      ... riding on monstrous beasts, all ... cast in lead,
      richly painted over and gilt."</p>
    <p>Master Etheridge's house, thrusting out an iron
      arm from which hung a blue-painted square board
      with a great gilt acorn, was quite as tall and "fair"<span class="pagenum"><a
          id="Page_120" name="Page_120">[120]</a></span>
      as any of the ten in the neighbouring "frame."
      Its upper stories were bright with the many small
      panes of wide projecting windows. The shop, whose
      front was usually open to the street by day, occupied
      the full width, and a good part of the depth, of the
      ground floor. Behind the shop was a "gallery" or
      passage, with a private entrance from the side street,
      and with a stairway; beyond this passage was the
      kitchen; and over that, the dining-room, which
      looked down upon a back yard that was really a
      small garden.</p>
    <p>Upon the low plastered ceiling of the dining-room
      was moulded a curious design of golden acorns. The
      walls were hung with tapestry representing a chase
      of deer. The floor was covered with rushes, which
      crackled under the feet of the boys that waited upon
      the family at supper.</p>
    <p>Captain Ravenshaw, with face clean-shaven all but
      for the skilfully up-turned moustaches and the tiny
      lip-tuft, leaned back in his carven chair after a comforting
      draught of his host's canary, drew his foot
      away from the dog that was pretending to mistake
      it for a bone under the table, and thought how lucky
      were those who supped every day at the board of
      Thomas Etheridge.</p>
    <p>"Yes," said Master Etheridge, who was a man
      square-faced, square-bodied, hard-eyed, hard-voiced,
      looking and sounding as if he should deal rather in<span class="pagenum"><a
          id="Page_121" name="Page_121">[121]</a></span>
      iron than in the softer, sunnier metal, a man with a
      shrewd mouth and a keen glance; but just now, for
      once, a little mellowed by the recollections of youth
      which his visitor had stirred; "your father was ever
      a man to have his will or raise a storm else. He led
      your poor mother many a mad dance. Be thankful
      all husbands are not as obstinate as Frank Holyday,
      Jane."</p>
    <p>Jane, the goldsmith's wife, looked as if she could
      tell a tale or two of husband's obstinacy, that would
      match any to be told of the elder Holyday; but she
      sweetly refrained. She was a plump, handsome
      woman, who filled her velvet bodice and white stomacher
      to the utmost on the safe side of bursting;
      she was the complete housewife, precise about the
      proper starching of the ruffs and collars, nice in her
      dress, of an even temper, choosing serenity rather
      than supremacy. So she merely beamed the more
      placidly upon the visitor, and said:</p>
    <p>"I warrant this young gentleman will not copy his
      father in that. His looks show the making of a kind
      husband. I wish you joy, Master Holyday."</p>
    <p>For the pretended Holyday had told the goldsmith
      in the shop that he was about to marry a
      young lady of Kent, wherefore he wished presently
      to buy plate and jewelry. This news had turned
      the cool reception of an uninvited caller into the
      cordial welcome of a possible customer. And, as it<span class="pagenum"><a
          id="Page_122" name="Page_122">[122]</a></span>
      was a guarantee against his wooing the daughter of
      the house, for whom a man of the Holydays' moderate
      estate was no acceptable suitor, it had removed
      the paternal objection to his presence in the family
      circle. Hence the goldsmith had honoured the
      claims of hospitality, and invited his old friend's supposed
      son to supper.</p>
    <p>On being introduced to the ladies, Ravenshaw
      had promptly recognised the maid of that February
      night. On her part, his voice had seemed to touch
      her memory distinctly, but the transformation wrought
      by the razor had puzzled her as to his face. At supper,
      sitting opposite him in silence, she had listened
      alertly while he had continued deluding her father
      with anecdotes of the elder Holyday; and she had
      shyly scrutinised his face. He had covertly noticed
      this. No doubt she was racking her brain in efforts
      to identify him. Why not enlighten her? The
      knowledge that he was in the secret of her attempted
      flight would give him a power over her. So he had
      said, to her father:</p>
    <p>"Oh, pardon my forgetting, sir. I was wrong
      when I told you I had not been in London except in
      passing to Cambridge and back. I was here over
      night last February." At this he had brought his
      eyes to bear full on Mistress Millicent. "I was in
      this neighbourhood, too. But the hour was so late,
      I durs'n't intrude on you. Indeed, no one was abroad<span class="pagenum"><a
          id="Page_123" name="Page_123">[123]</a></span>
      in the streets but roysterers, and brawlers, and runaways,
      and such."</p>
    <p>The girl's face had turned of a colour with her
      lips, her eyes had flashed complete recognition, had
      met his for an instant in a startled plea for silence,
      then had hid themselves under their long lashes.
      Ravenshaw, feeling as if he had struck a blow at
      something helpless, had glanced quickly at her
      parents. They had been busy with their knives and
      spoons, fingers and napkins, and had observed nothing.</p>
    <p>Curiosity and fear, the captain had thought, would
      now make her grant, if not seek, a word with him
      alone. After that, he had not rested his look upon
      her again during the supper. He had met her father's
      eyes readily enough, and her mother's, and those of
      the ladies' woman, the head shopman, and the other
      dependents at the lower part of the table, but not
      hers.</p>
    <p>For, of a truth, she was not the vain and affected
      hussy, or the stiff and supercilious minx, or the bold
      and impudent hoyden, he had expected to find as the
      only daughter of a purse-proud citizen. Every movement
      of her slim young figure, encased in a close
      blue taffeta gown, seemed to express innocence and
      gentleness; her oval face, rich in the colour of
      blushes, lips, and blue eyes, had a most ineffable
      softness; even her hair, brown and fine, parting<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_124"
          name="Page_124">[124]</a></span>
      across her brow without too many waves, gave an
      impression of grace and tenderness; and over her
      countenance, whose natural habit was one of kindly
      cheerfulness, there now lay something plaintive.
      Ravenshaw found it not easy to face her, knowing
      for what purpose he had lied himself into her
      presence.</p>
    <p>And now, the trenchers being nearly bare, and
      mouths having more leisure to talk than the voracious
      custom of that day allowed them during meals,
      Master Etheridge was minded for further reminiscence
      of his old friend.</p>
    <p>"Ay, ay, many's the quart of wine we've drunk
      together after supper, in my rash days. Your father
      would have all drink that were about him. Even
      his dogs he would make drunk. A great man for
      dogs. I mind me of a prick-eared cur he had, would
      drink sack with the best of us, and sit on a stool at
      table with us, and howl with us when we sang our
      ballads. And there was a terrier, too; I have my
      reason not to forget him."</p>
    <p>"Yes," quoth Ravenshaw; "he bit you in the
      calf o' the leg the last time you were at our house."</p>
    <p>"Nay, that was a water-spaniel did that," said the
      goldsmith.</p>
    <p>Ravenshaw remembered now that Holyday had
      said a water-spaniel; but he thought it would appear
      the more natural if he should seem to be in this<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_125"
          name="Page_125">[125]</a></span>
      point tricked by memory, as, in some detail or other,
      people often are.</p>
    <p>"Nay," said he, "I am sure it was the terrier; I
      remember it as well&#8212;"</p>
    <p>"Oh, no, never, never the terrier; 'twas the
      water-spaniel, on my word. Why, I never see the
      spaniels diving for ducks in the ponds at Islington
      but I think of it."</p>
    <p>But Ravenshaw feigned to be unconvinced, and
      when, after some further talk, he yielded the point,
      it was as if merely out of courtesy. When the
      supper party rose from the table, the captain was
      for a pipe of tobacco, which he forthwith produced.
      But Master Etheridge said he was no tobacconist,
      and that the smoke made his lady ill. Ravenshaw
      replied that, by their leave, he would then take a
      turn or two, and a whiff or two, in the garden, whose
      beauty, observed by him from the window, invited
      closer acquaintance. Etheridge liked to hear his
      garden commended before his wife, as its implied
      sufficiency saved him the expense of a garden with
      a summer-house in the suburbs, which many a
      citizeness compelled her husband to possess. So
      he went cheerfully ahead to show the way.</p>
    <p>"When you return, you shall find us in the withdrawing
      room, across the passage," said Mistress
      Etheridge.</p>
    <p>Ravenshaw bowed to the ladies; in doing which,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_126"
          name="Page_126">[126]</a></span>
      he met Mistress Millicent's eyes with a look that
      said as plainly as spoken words: "I have something
      for your ears." This intimation, in view of the circumstances
      of their former meeting, could not fail to
      engage her interest.</p>
    <p>The goldsmith led him down-stairs to the ground
      floor passage, whence a door opened to a narrow way
      running past the rear of the house to the little garden.
      This comprised a square of green turf, in the
      centre of which was an apple-tree, now in blossom;
      a walk led to and around this tree, and another walk
      enclosed the whole square. This latter walk was
      flanked on the outer side by rosemary and various
      shrubbery, banks of pinks and other flowers; which
      screened the garden walls except where a gate gave
      entrance from Friday Street. The farther side of
      the garden was sheltered by a small arbour of vines;
      beneath this was a bench, and another bench stood
      out upon the turf, so that one might sit either in sun
      or in shade.</p>
    <p>It was still daylight; the regular household supper
      was taken early in those times, and English days are
      long in May. Yet an early star or two showed
      themselves in the clear sky. The scent of the pinks
      and apple-blossoms was in the air.</p>
    <p>"A sweet night toward," said the goldsmith,
      manifesting an inclination to remain with his guest
      in the garden. But this was what Ravenshaw did<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_127"
          name="Page_127">[127]</a></span>
      not desire. The captain, therefore, as soon as he
      had lighted his pipe, took Master Etheridge's arm
      so as to have the greater pretext for walking close to
      him, and blew such volumes of smoke in the poor
      man's direction that, for the sake of his eyes and
      nostrils, being no "tobacconist," he was soon glad
      to make excuse for returning into the house, and to
      hasten back, coughing and blinking.</p>
    <p>"If she is a woman," mused the captain, left alone,
      "she will come to hear what I may tell her. She
      has been on pins and needles. By this light, what
      a piece of chance!&#8212;that this maid should be that
      one! What shall I say to her? I must open upon
      the matter of that night. Tut, has she not yet
      observed I am alone here now? Or has she not the
      freedom of the house? or the wit to devise means of
      coming hither? Well, I will give her the time of
      this pipeful. What a sweet evening!"</p>
    <p>But the sweetness of the evening made him only
      sigh uneasily, and feel more out of sorts with himself.
      Several minutes passed, and he was thinking
      he might have to resort to some keen stroke of
      wit to get private speech with her, after all; when
      suddenly she appeared, with ghostlike swiftness, at
      the corner where the passage along the kitchen
      wing gave into the garden. He was, at the moment,
      scarce ten feet from that spot.</p>
    <p>She was blushing and perturbed. She cast a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_128"
          name="Page_128">[128]</a></span>
      look up at the dining-room window, then glanced
      at him, and, instantly dropping her eyes, sped over
      the turf to the farther side of the apple-tree. He
      quickly followed her; and when, thereupon, they
      stood together, the tree screened them from the
      house.</p>
    <p>Without looking at him, and tremblingly plucking
      the apple-blossoms to hide her confusion, she said,
      quickly:</p>
    <p>"Sir, I thank you for what you did that night.
      You will not tell them, will you?"</p>
    <p>He thought that, by promising unconditionally,
      he should lose a possible means of controlling her
      actions; so he must, for the moment, evade.</p>
    <p>"Then they know not?" he queried.</p>
    <p>"Nay; I got in, and to my chamber, without
      waking any one."</p>
    <p>"And had you no further molestation in the
      streets? One of those men tricked me, and followed
      you. I learned it after."</p>
    <p>She looked at him with a little surprise. "Nay,
      I saw him not, nor heard him. I had no trouble.
      But you will not tell?"</p>
    <p>Her wide-open eyes, round and large and of the
      deepest blue, were turned straight upon his face,
      as if they meant to leave him not till they should
      have a direct answer.</p>

      <div class="figcenter">

         <p class="center">"'SIR, I THANK YOU FOR WHAT YOU DID THAT NIGHT'"</p>
      </div>

    <p>"Why&#8212;mistress," he blundered, and then
      <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span>dropped his own gaze
      to where he was beginning
      to scrape the gravel awkwardly with his shoe,
      "why need you ask? Did I not protect your
      secret that night?"</p>
    <p>"Then why do you hesitate now?" she demanded,
      with a sudden unconcealed mistrust. "Oh, Master
      Holyday, what is in your mind? Why have you
      drawn me hither to speak with you alone? Why
      do you make a doubt of promising not to betray
      me? Come, sir, I have little time; they will soon
      be wondering where I am; either promise me, or
      I myself will tell them, and then, by St. Anne, I
      care not&#8212;"</p>
    <p>There was a threat of weeping in her voice and
      face, and Ravenshaw impulsively threw up his hand,
      and said:</p>
    <p>"Nay, fear not. I will not tell. I give my word."</p>
    <p>Trouble fled from her face, and a smile of gratitude
      made her appear doubly charming.</p>
    <p>Ravenshaw cleared his throat, without reason,
      and tried to meet her glance without seeing her,
      if that had been possible.</p>
    <p>"You are a happy maid," quoth he, settling down
      to a disagreeable business. "'Tis proven that you
      may play the runaway for an hour or two, when
      you wish, and none be the wiser. There's many a
      maid would give her best gown thrice over, for
      that assurance."</p>
    <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span></p>
    <p>"Troth, it serves me nothing," she said, with a
      forlornness he could not understand. "An I were
      to play the runaway again, whither should I run?"</p>
    <p>He thought for an instant of going into the
      mystery of her former desire to run away; but
      he decided that, as time pressed, it were better
      to hold to the present design.</p>
    <p>"Whither, indeed?" quoth he. "Faith, London
      has no lack of pleasant bowers, where beauty may
      hear itself praised by the lips of love. Sure, you
      look as if I talked Greek to you. Certainly you
      are wont to hear yourself admired?"</p>
    <p>"Oh!" she murmured, at a loss, with a smile, and
      a blush of confusion.</p>
    <p>"Troth, now," said he; "confess you enjoy to be
      admired."</p>
    <p>"Oh, pray," she faltered, "talk not of such things.
      I know not how to answer."</p>
    <p>"Yet you take pleasure in hearing them? Come,
      the truth, mistress. Faith, 'tis but a simple question."</p>
    <p>"Oh&#8212;why&#8212;I do&#8212;and I do not."</p>
    <p>"I warrant," quoth he, softly, "there would be no
      'I do not,' if the right gentleman spoke them."
      The captain's tone seemed lightly gay and bantering;
      but, though she knew it not, his throat was
      dry, and he was trembling from head to foot like
      a shivering terrier.</p>
    <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span></p>
    <p>"I am sure I know not," she answered, embarrassedly,
      but still smiling.</p>
    <p>"Put it to the test," he whispered, huskily.
      "Give him the occasion to speak&#8212;one that adores
      you&#8212;hear him utter your praises&#8212;hear him vow
      his devotion&#8212;give him the occasion."</p>
    <p>"Methinks&#8212;you take the occasion now," said
      she, in a voice scarce above the rustle of the air
      among the leaves.</p>
    <p>"Nay&#8212;heaven's light!&#8212;I mean not myself!" he
      said, dismayed.</p>
    <p>"Why, wha&#8212;? What then? What mean you?"</p>
    <p>Her smile had fled in a breath, and in its place
      was a look of suddenly awakened horror that smote
      him like a whip's blow across the eyes.</p>
    <p>"Oh, nothing," he stammered. "I mean&#8212;'tis
      not myself that's worthy to praise you. I know not&#8212;I
      am out of my wits&#8212;forget&#8212;"</p>
    <p>Just then a woman's voice was heard calling
      from the house, "Mistress Millicent, where art
      thou?"</p>
    <p>"'Tis Lettice, my mother's woman," whispered
      the girl, quickly. "I must in. I have come out for
      this bunch of apple-blossoms. Some other time
      we'll talk&#8212;perhaps."</p>
    <p>Without another word she ran from the garden.</p>
    <p>The captain snapped his pipe in two, and flung
      the pieces to the ground; then turned toward the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_132"
          name="Page_132">[132]</a></span>
      evening sky, in which a numerous company of stars
      now twinkled, a face bitter with self-loathing.</p>
    <p>"I am a beast," he hissed; "a slave, a scavenger,
      a raker of rags, fit company for the dead curs in
      Houndsditch. Foh! but, by God's light and by this
      hand, I swear&#8212;"</p>
    <p>He raised his hand toward the stars, and finished
      his oath, whatever it was, in thought, not in speech.
      Then, suddenly resuming his former mien, he turned
      and walked rapidly into the house.</p>

    <h2><a id="CHAPTER_VIII" name="CHAPTER_VIII">CHAPTER VIII.</a></h2>
    <div class="center">SIR PEREGRINE MEDWAY.</div>

      <blockquote><p>"How the roses, <br />
      That kept continual spring within her cheeks, <br />
      Are withered with the old man's dull embraces!" <br />
      &#8212;<i>The Night-Walker.</i><br /></p>
      </blockquote>

    <p>As the captain entered, he heard some little
      bustle, as of an arrival. In the lower passage, at the
      door leading to the kitchen, was a strange serving-man,
      already on terms of banter with the cook and
      maids. He was provided with a torch, as yet unlighted;
      evidently the guest he attended would stay
      till after dark. Ravenshaw climbed the narrow
      stairs to the withdrawing-room, of which the door
      was open.</p>
    <p>This was a fine large room, with an oaken ceiling
      and oaken panelling; with veiled pictures and veiled
      statues in niches; with solid chairs, carved chests
      and coffers, tables covered with rich Eastern "carpets;"
      with a wide window bulging out over Cheapside,
      and with a great, handsome chimneypiece. The
      floor was strewn with clean rushes. Some boughs
      burning in the fireplace gave forth a pleasant odour.
      A boy was lighting the candles in the sconces.</p>
    <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span></p>
    <p>Ravenshaw's glance took in these details at the
      same moment in which it embraced the group of
      people in the room. The goldsmith and his wife
      stood beaming, and the woman Lettice looked on at
      a respectful distance, while in the centre of the room
      was Mistress Millicent in the grasp of a tall, lean
      old gentleman in gorgeous raiment, who very gallantly
      kissed both her cheeks and then both her
      hands.</p>
    <p>"Sweet, sweet," this ancient gallant lisped to her,
      "I can see how thou hast pined. But all is well
      now; I am with thee again; my leg is mended.
      Thou wert not fated to lose thy Sir Peregrine for all
      the ramping horses in England. So cheerily, cheerily
      now. Smooth thy face; I see how thou'st grieved,
      and I love thee the better for it."</p>
    <p>Mistress Millicent certainly looked far from happy;
      but her dejection at that moment seemed to proceed
      less from any past apprehension for the visitor's
      safety than from a present antipathy to his embraces.
      She was pale and red by turns, and she
      drew back from him with much relief the instant he
      released her. Her eyes met those of Ravenshaw,
      and she blushed exceedingly, and looked as if she
      would sink out of observation.</p>
    <p>"Come in, Master Holyday," said the goldsmith
      seeing the captain in the doorway. "Come in and
      be known to Sir Peregrine Medway. Master Holy<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_135"
          name="Page_135">[135]</a></span>day's
      father is an old friend of mine, that was my
      neighbour in Kent."</p>
    <p>"Holyday, Holyday," repeated Sir Peregrine, with
      indifferent thoughtfulness, looking at the captain
      carelessly. "My first wife had a cousin that was a
      Holyday, or some such name, but not of Kent. Sir,
      I crave your better acquaintance," to which polite
      expression the old knight gave the lie by turning
      from the captain as if he dismissed him for ever
      from his consciousness, and offering his hand to
      Mistress Etheridge to lead her to a chair.</p>
    <p>"What withered reed of courtesy, what stockfish
      of gallantry, may this be?" mused Ravenshaw, striding
      to a corner where he might sit unregarded.</p>
    <p>"You should have come hither straightway, bag
      and baggage," said Master Etheridge to the old fop.
      "What need was there to go to the inn first?"</p>
    <p>"Need? Oh, for shame, sir! Would you have
      me seen in the clothes I travelled in? Good lack,
      I trow not! Thinkst thou we that live in Berkshire
      know not good manners?" The knight spoke in
      pleasantry; it was clear he accounted himself the
      mirror of politeness. "What sayst thou, mother?"</p>
    <p>"Oh, what you do is ever right, Sir Peregrine,"
      replied Mistress Etheridge, placidly. But Ravenshaw,
      in his corner, was almost startled into mirth at
      hearing the wrinkled old visitor address the youthful-looking
      matron as mother. What did it mean?</p>
    <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span></p>
    <p>Sir Peregrine bowed, with his hand on his heart;
      in which motion his eye fell upon a speck of something
      black upon the lower part of his stocking.
      Stooping further to remove it, and striving not to
      bend his knees in the action, he narrowly escaped
      overbalancing; and came up red-faced and panting.
      Ravenshaw thought he detected in Mistress Millicent's
      face a flash of malicious pleasure at the old
      fellow's discomfiture. She had taken a seat by the
      chimneypiece, where she seemed to be nursing a
      kind of suppressed fury.</p>
    <p>The knight, after his moment of peril, dropped
      into a chair in rather a tottering fashion, and sat
      complacently regarding his own figure and attire.</p>
    <p>The figure was shrugged up, and as spare as that
      of Don Quixote&#8212;a person, at that time, not yet
      known to the world. It was dressed in a suit of
      peach-colour satin, with slashes and openings over
      cloth of silver; with wings, ribbons, and garters.
      His shoes were adorned with great rosettes; a
      ribbon was tied in the love-lock hanging by his
      ear; and a huge ruff compelled him to hold high
      a head naturally designed to sink low between his
      sharp shoulders. His face, a triangle with the forehead
      as base, was pallid and dried-up; the eyes were
      small and streaky, the nose long and thin, the chin
      tipped with a little pointed beard, which, like the
      up-turned moustaches and the hair of the head, was<span class="pagenum"><a
          id="Page_137" name="Page_137">[137]</a></span>
      dyed a reddish brown. On this countenance reposed
      a look of the utmost sufficiency, that of a person
      who takes himself seriously, and who never dreams
      that any one can doubt his greatness or his charms.</p>
    <p>From the subsequent talk, it became known to
      Ravenshaw that Sir Peregrine had, a few months
      before, been thrown by a horse on his estate in
      Berkshire, and had but now recovered fully from
      the effects. The knight described the accident with
      infinite detail, and with supreme concern for himself,
      repeating the same circumstances over and over
      again. He was equally particular and reiterative in
      his account of his slow recovery. His auditors, making
      show of great attention and solicitude, punctuated
      his narrative with many yawns and frequent noddings;
      but on and on he lisped and cackled.</p>
    <p>"Good lack," said he, "there was such coming
      and going of neighbours for news of how I did!
      I never knew so much ado made in Berkshire; faith,
      I lamented that I should be the cause on't, such
      disturbance of the public peace, and I a justice.
      And what with the ladies coming in dozens to nurse
      me!&#8212;troth, that they all might have a share on't,
      and none be offended, I must needs be watched of
      three at a time&#8212;What, sweet?" He was casting
      a roguish look at Mistress Millicent. "Art vexed?
      Art cast down? Good lack! see how jealous it is!
      Fie, fie, sweetheart! Am I to blame if the ladies<span class="pagenum"><a
          id="Page_138" name="Page_138">[138]</a></span>
      would flock around me? Comfort thyself; I am
      all thine."</p>
    <p>Mistress Millicent, despite her vexation, of which
      the cause was other than he assumed, could not
      help laughing outright. The captain began to see
      how matters stood. But old Sir Peregrine was untouched
      by her brief outburst of mirth, and continued
      to shake a finger of raillery at her.</p>
    <p>"Sweet, sweet, ye're all alike, all womankind.
      My first wife was so, and my second wife was so;
      and now my third that is to be."</p>
    <p>The girl's face blazed like a poppy with fury, and
      her blue eyes flashed with rebellion. She looked
      all the more young, and fresh, and warm with life,
      for that; and when Ravenshaw glanced from her
      to the colourless, shrivelled old knight&#8212;from the
      humid rose in its first bloom, to the withered rush&#8212;he
      felt for an instant a choking sickness of disgust.
      But the girl's parents remained serenely
      callous, and the old coxcomb, with equal insensibility,
      prattled on, putting it to the blame of nature
      that he should be, without intent, so much the
      desire of ladies and the jealousy of his wives past
      and to come.</p>
    <p>Meanwhile Mistress Etheridge, having silently left
      the room with the woman Lettice, returned alone,
      and begged Sir Peregrine to come and partake of
      a little supper. From the knight's alacrity in<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_139"
          name="Page_139">[139]</a></span>
      accepting, it was plain he had honoured the family
      doubly,&#8212;first by tarrying to change his clothes
      for his call, and then by not tarrying to eat before
      coming to them, an additional honour that Mistress
      Etheridge had divined. With courtly bows and
      flourishes, he followed her toward the dining-chamber;
      whither he was followed in turn, for
      politeness' sake, by the goldsmith, who apologised
      to Ravenshaw for leaving him.</p>
    <p>Whatever were the captain's feelings, Mistress
      Millicent seemed glad, or at least relieved, to be
      alone with him.</p>
    <p>"I wish you joy of your coming marriage," said
      Ravenshaw, tentatively.</p>
    <p>"You would as well wish me joy of my death,"
      she replied, with a mixture of anger and forlornness.</p>
    <p>He rose and walked over to the fireplace, near
      her.</p>
    <p>"Why, 'tis true," quoth he; "when the bride
      is young, the arms of an old husband are a grave."</p>
    <p>"Worse! When one is dead in one's grave, one
      knows nothing; but to be alive in those arms&#8212;foh!"</p>
    <p>"Your good parents will have you take this husband,
      I trow, whether you will or no?"</p>
    <p>"Yes; and I shall love them the less for it,"
      she replied, sadly.</p>
    <p>"Has a contract passed between you?"</p>
    <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span></p>
    <p>"Not on my part, I can swear to that! Before
      Sir Peregrine went back to Berkshire the last time,
      they tried to have a betrothal before witnesses; but
      I let fall both the ring he wished to force upon
      me and the ring I was to give him; I would not
      open my lips either to speak, or to return his kiss;
      I held my hand back, closed tight, and he had to
      take it of his own accord. And all this the witnesses
      noted, for they laughed and spoke of it
      among themselves."</p>
    <p>"Is the wedding-day set?"</p>
    <p>"It may be any day, now that Sir Peregrine is
      well and in London. No doubt they will get a
      license, to save thrice asking the banns. I hope
      I may die in my sleep ere the time comes!"</p>
    <p>"'Twere pity if that hope came true," said Ravenshaw,
      smiling.</p>
    <p>"I dare not hope for a better escape. I'm not
      like to be favoured again as I was the other time
      Sir Peregrine was coming to town for the marriage.
      Then his horse threw him, and gave me a respite&#8212;but
      for only three months. Now he is well
      again, and safe and sound in London."</p>
    <p>"What, were you in this peril three months
      ago?"</p>
    <p>"Yes. 'Twas that which made me try to run
      away, the night you first saw me. The next day,
      instead of him, came news of his accident."</p>
    <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span></p>
    <p>"Whither would you have run?"</p>
    <p>"To my Uncle Bartlemy's, in Kent. You know
      him of course; he lives near your father."</p>
    <p>"Oh, yes, yes, certainly," replied the supposed
      Holyday.</p>
    <p>"And you saw him that night; at least, you told
      me the watch had let him go."</p>
    <p>"What, was that your Uncle Bartlemy?&#8212;the
      old gentleman you were to have met&#8212;the man
      my friends and I rescued from the watch!"</p>
    <p>"I knew not 'twas you had rescued him; but
      'twas he I went to meet at the Standard. Nay,
      then, if 'twas Uncle Bartlemy you rescued, you
      would have known him!"</p>
    <p>"Oh, as for that," blundered Ravenshaw, realising
      how nearly he had betrayed himself, "no doubt 'twas
      your Uncle Bartlemy, now I think on't; but I recognised
      him not that night. For, look you, he took
      pains to keep unknown; and all was darkness and
      haste; and though we are neighbours, I see but little
      of him; and he is the last man I should expect to
      meet in London abroad in the streets after curfew."</p>
    <p>"That is true enough," she said, with a smile;
      "and I hope you will not play the telltale upon
      him. If his wife knew he had been to London,
      there would be an end of all peace. Sure, you
      must promise me not to tell; for 'twas my pleading
      brought him to London."</p>
    <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span></p>
    <p>"Oh, trust me. I give my word. So he came
      to help you run away from being married to this
      old knight?"</p>
    <p>"Yes. You know there's no love lost betwixt
      Uncle Bartlemy and my father. But mine uncle
      hath doted upon me from the first, the more, perchance,
      because he hath no child of his own. And
      I think he loves me doubly, for the quarrel he has
      with my father."</p>
    <p>"And so he had not the heart to refuse when you
      begged him to come and carry you away to his
      house," conjectured Ravenshaw.</p>
    <p>"'Tis so. 'Twas the only way I could devise to
      escape the marriage. I thought, if all could be
      done by night, I might be concealed in mine uncle's
      house; and even if my father should think of
      going there to seek me, he could be put off with
      denials."</p>
    <p>"But what would your uncle's wife have said to
      this?"</p>
    <p>"Oh, Aunt Margaret is bitter against my father;
      she would delight to hoodwink him. The only doubt
      was how mine uncle might come and take me, without
      her knowing of his visit to London. For, of a truth,
      she would never consent to his setting foot inside
      London town; and there was no one else I dared
      trust to conduct me. And so we had it that Uncle
      Bartlemy should feign to go to Rochester, and then,<span class="pagenum"><a
          id="Page_143" name="Page_143">[143]</a></span>
      on his way home, to have happened upon me in my
      flight."</p>
    <p>"And so your aunt be none the wiser? Well,
      such folly deserves to be cozened&#8212;the folly of
      forbidding her husband coming to London."</p>
    <p>"Oh," replied Mistress Millicent, blushing a little
      as she smiled, "my dear aunt is, in truth, as jealous
      as Sir Peregrine would have us believe his wives
      were. There is a lady in London that Uncle Bartlemy
      played servant to before he was married, and
      Aunt Margaret made him promise never to come
      within sight of the town."</p>
    <p>"I marvel how you laid your plans with him, without
      discovery of your people or his."</p>
    <p>"There was a carrier's man that goes betwixt
      London and Rochester, who used to come courting
      one of our maids. We passed letters privately by
      means of him, till he fell out with the maid, and now
      comes hither no more. The last word I had of my
      uncle was after that night. He told me of his mishap
      with the watch, and of his getting free&#8212;though
      he said not how. And he vowed he must leave me
      to my fate, for he would never venture for me again
      as he had done. So I was left without hope. When
      I recognised you to-day as my preserver that night,
      and remembered that the Holydays were my uncle's
      neighbours, I thought&#8212;mayhap&#8212;you might have
      some message from him; but, alas&#8212;!"</p>
    <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span></p>
    <p>"And that is why you followed me to the garden?"
      said the captain, carelessly, though inwardly
      he winced.</p>
    <p>"Ay. Your look seemed to promise&#8212;but woe's
      me! And yet you spoke of my running away
      again?"</p>
    <p>"Oh, I talked wildly. I know not what possessed
      me. Some things I said must have been very strange."</p>
    <p>"Why, forsooth," said she, smiling again, and colouring
      most sweetly, "they seemed not so strange at
      the time, for I had forgot you are to be married; but
      now that I remember that&#8212;Belike you imagined
      for a moment you were speaking to the lady you are
      to marry?"</p>
    <p>"Belike that is so. But touching this marriage:
      what is to hinder your running away to your uncle's
      now, with a trusty person to conduct you?"</p>
    <p>"My uncle, in his letter, said he washed his hands
      of my affairs. He counselled me to make the best
      of Sir Peregrine's estate; he gave me warning he
      would not harbour me if I came to him."</p>
    <p>"A most loving uncle, truly!"</p>
    <p>"Nay, his love had not altered. But what befell
      him in London that night gave him such a fright of
      meddling in the matter."</p>
    <p>"Perchance his warning was only to keep you from
      some rash flight. And, mayhap, now that his fears
      have passed away, he would receive you."</p>
    <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a></span></p>
    <p>"I know not. If I might try!&#8212;hush, they are
      coming back!"</p>
    <p>Ravenshaw could hear Sir Peregrine's cracked
      voice in the passage; but he ventured, quickly:</p>
    <p>"I'd fain talk more of this&#8212;alone with you.
      When?"</p>
    <p>"When you will," she replied, hurriedly. "I know
      not your plans."</p>
    <p>"In your garden, then," he said at a hazard; "to-morrow
      at nightfall. Let the side gate be unlocked."</p>
    <p>"I'll try. But do not you fail."</p>
    <p>"Trust me; and meanwhile, if they turn sudden in
      the matter, and resolve to have the marriage forthwith,
      find shift to put it off, though you must e'en
      fall ill to hinder it."</p>
    <p>"I'll vex myself into a fever, if need be!"</p>
    <p>Ravenshaw was on his feet when the elder people
      came in; he advanced toward them as if he had waited
      impatiently that he might take his leave. As for
      Mistress Millicent, at sight of Sir Peregrine her face
      took on at once the petulant, rebellious look it had
      worn at his departure; no one would have supposed
      she had conversed during his absence.</p>
    <p>When the captain had dismissed himself, he looked
      back for a moment from the threshold. The limping
      old coxcomb, more than ever self-satisfied after his
      supper, was bestowing a loverlike caress upon Mistress
      Millicent, who shrank from him as if she were<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_146"
          name="Page_146">[146]</a></span>
      a flower whose beauty might wither at his touch.
      With this vision before him, Ravenshaw was let out,
      by the side door, into Friday Street, and made his
      way eastward along Cheapside to meet the scholar
      by appointment among the evening idlers in the Pawn
      of the Exchange. He thought industriously, as he
      went.</p>

    <h2><a id="CHAPTER_IX" name="CHAPTER_IX">CHAPTER IX.</a></h2>
    <div class="center">THE PRAISE OF INNOCENCE.</div>
    <blockquote>
      <p>"He keeps his promise best that breaks with hell."&#8212;<i>The Widow.</i></p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>The Royal Exchange, or Gresham's Bourse,
      formed an open quadrangle, where the merchants
      congregated by day, which was surrounded by a
      colonnade; the roofed galleries over the colonnade
      made up the Pawn, where ladies and gentlemen
      walked and lounged in the evening, among bazaars
      and stalls. Naturally the uses of such a resort were
      not lost upon Captain Ravenshaw and Master Holyday,
      who had reasons for knowing all places where a
      houseless man might keep warm or dry in bad
      weather without cost. When Ravenshaw entered,
      on this particular May evening, he found the Pawn
      crowded, and lighted in a manner brilliant for those
      days. The scholar was leaning, pensive, against a
      post.</p>
    <p>"God save you, man, why look you so disconsolate?
      Is it the sight of so many ladies?"</p>
    <p>"No. I heed 'em not, when I am not asked to
      speak to 'em," replied Holyday, listlessly. "How
      fared you?"</p>
    <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span></p>
    <p>"Oh,&#8212;so so. The trick served. Faith, I e'en
      began to think myself I was Master Holyday. But
      what's the matter?"</p>
    <p>It was evident the captain did not wish to talk of
      his own affair. The scholar was not the man to
      poke his nose into other people's matters. But
      neither was he one to make any secret of his own
      concerns when questioned.</p>
    <p>"Oh, 'tis not much. I have been commissioned
      to write a play."</p>
    <p>"What?" cried the captain, eagerly. "For which
      playhouse?&#8212;the Globe?&#8212;the Blackfriars?&#8212;the
      Fortune?"</p>
    <p>"Nay," said the scholar, sedately; "for Wat
      Stiles's puppet-show."</p>
    <p>"Oh!&#8212;well, is not that good news? Is there
      not money in it? Why should it make you down i'
      the mouth?"</p>
    <p>"Oh, 'tis not the writing of the play&#8212;but I have
      no money to buy paper and ink, and no place to
      write in."</p>
    <p>"What, did the rascal showman give you no
      earnest money?"</p>
    <p>"Yes; but I forgot, and spent it for supper. I
      knew you would make shift to sup at the goldsmith's."</p>
    <p>"Ay, marry, 'twould have gone hard else. Well,
      I am glad thou hast eaten. It saves our shifting for<span class="pagenum"><a
          id="Page_149" name="Page_149">[149]</a></span>
      thy supper. Troth, we shall come by ink and paper.
      The thing is now to find beds for the night. Would
      I had appointed to meet my gentleman this evening."
      But suddenly, at this, the captain's face lengthened.</p>
    <p>"When are you to meet him?"</p>
    <p>"At ten to-morrow, in the Temple church," said
      the captain, dubiously. After a moment's silence,
      he added, "And to think that the fat of the land
      awaits you in Kent whenever you choose to take a
      wife to your father's house there! Well, well, it
      must come to your getting the better of that mad
      bashfulness&#8212;it must come to that in time."</p>
    <p>"Why," quoth Holyday, surprised, "have you not
      assured me that women are vipers?"</p>
    <p>"Ay, most of them, indeed&#8212;but not all; not
      all." The captain spoke thoughtfully.</p>
    <p>"Well," said Holyday, after a pause, "I think I
      shall lodge in Cold Harbour first, ere I take one home
      to my father." Cold Harbour was a house in which
      vagabonds and debtors had sanctuary; but the two
      friends had so far steered clear of it, the captain not
      liking the company or the management thereof.</p>
    <p>Leaving the Exchange, they found the streets alive
      with people; not only had the fine weather brought
      out the citizens, but the town was full of countryfolk
      up for the Trinity law term.</p>
    <p>"'Odslid," a rustic esquire was overheard by the
      captain to say to another, "I looked to lie at the<span class="pagenum"><a
          id="Page_150" name="Page_150">[150]</a></span>
      Bell to-night, but not a bed's to be had there. 'Twill
      go hard if all the inns&#8212;"</p>
    <p>"Excellent," whispered Ravenshaw to the scholar.
      "We shall sleep dry of the dews to-night&#8212;else I'm
      a simple parish ass. Come."</p>
    <p>They went at once to the sign of the Bell, where
      the captain applied, with an important air, for a
      chamber. On hearing that the house was full, he
      made a great ado, saying he and his friend wished to
      leave early in the morning in Hobson's wagon starting
      from that inn; being late risers by habit, they
      durst not trust themselves to sleep elsewhere, lest
      they miss the wagon. Finally, going into the inn
      yard, the captain stated his case to one of Hobson's
      men, and suggested that he and his companion might
      lie overnight in the tilt-wagon itself, so as to make
      sure of not being left behind in the morning. The
      carrier, glad to get two fares for the downward journey
      at a season when all the travel was up to town,
      thought the idea a good one. And so the two slept
      roomily that night on straw, well above ground,
      sheltered by the canvas cover of the huge wagon.
      In the morning, pretending they went for a bottle of
      wine, they did not return; and the carrier, whipping
      up his horses at the end of a vain wait of fifteen
      minutes, was provided with a subject of thought
      which lasted all the way to Edmonton.</p>
    <p>Meanwhile, the captain and the scholar, postponing<span class="pagenum"><a
          id="Page_151" name="Page_151">[151]</a></span>
      their breakfast, whiled away the time till ten o'clock.
      At that hour, having left his friend to loiter round
      Temple Bar, Ravenshaw stepped across the venerable
      threshold of the church of the Temple.</p>
    <p>This church, too, was a midday gathering-place, as
      was also Westminster Abbey. But ten o'clock was
      too early for the crowd, and the captain found himself
      almost alone among the recumbent figures, in
      dark marble, of bygone knights of the Temple in full
      armour. Not even the lawyers, in any considerable
      number, had yet taken their places by the clustered
      Norman pillars at which they received clients. The
      gentleman whom Ravenshaw had come to meet, to
      report the outcome of his attempt with the goldsmith's
      daughter, was not there.</p>
    <p>Master Jerningham, indeed, had cause to be late.
      He had cause also for his mind to be, if not upset, at
      least tumbled about. In the first place, though he
      did not try to resist it, he cursed his unreasonable
      passion for this girl, which took so much time and
      thought from his final preparations for the voyage on
      which he had set so heavy a stake. He had been
      compelled to leave many things to his companion
      gentlemen-adventurers, which he ought to have overseen
      himself. And even as matters were, he was
      not clear as to what he would be about, concerning
      the girl. Suppose he won her to a meeting, could
      such a passion as his be cooled in the few hours dur<span class="pagenum"><a
          id="Page_152" name="Page_152">[152]</a></span>ing
      which he might be with her before sailing? Or
      should he indeed, as he had hinted to Sir Clement,
      set himself to carry her off on his voyage by persuasion
      or force? He knew not; events must decide;
      only two things were certain&#8212;he must behold her
      a yielding conquest in his arms; and he must sail
      at the time set or as soon after as weather might
      permit.</p>
    <p>Upon leaving Ravenshaw in St. Paul's, the day
      before, he had gone to see a cunning man by whom
      his nativity had been cast with relation to the voyage.
      The astrologer had foretold an obstacle to be
      encountered at the last moment, and to be avoided
      only by great prudence. This had darkened Master
      Jerningham's thoughts for awhile, but he had forgotten
      it in the busy cares of the afternoon at Deptford,
      whither he had hastened to see the bestowal of
      stores upon the ship. He had already got his men
      down from London and Wapping, all taking part in
      the work, some living aboard, some at the inns; so
      as to risk no desertions. He had returned late to
      Winchester House, passed a restless night, slept a
      little after daylight, and set forth in good time before
      ten for his appointment.</p>
      <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[153]</a></span></p>

         <p class="center">BADE HIS VISITOR BE SEATED UPON A STONE BENCH, AND FACED HER SULLENLY.</p>
      </div>
    <p>Just as he was going down the water-stairs, a
      small craft shot in ahead of the boat his man Gregory
      had hailed; a woman sprang up from the stern and,
      gaining the stairs with a fearless leap, stood facing
him. She was a tall,
      finely made, ruddy-faced creature,
      in her twenties, attired in the shabby remains
      of a country gentlewoman's gown, and wearing a
      high-crowned, narrow-brimmed hat.</p>
    <p>"Name of the fiend!" muttered Master Jerningham,
      starting back in anger and confusion. "What
      the devil do you here?"</p>
    <p>"Peace," said the woman, in a low voice. "Have
      no fear. If your virtuous kinsman sees me, say I'm
      old Jeremy's niece come to tell you what men he'll
      need for the farm work." Her voice befitted her
      tall and goodly figure, being rich and full; the look
      upon her handsome countenance was one of mingled
      humiliation and scorn.</p>
    <p>"I am in haste," said Jerningham, in great
      vexation.</p>
    <p>"You must hear me first," she replied, resolutely.</p>
    <p>Jerningham, stifling his annoyance, motioned Gregory
      to keep the waterman waiting; then led the
      way up the stairs to the terrace, bade his visitor be
      seated upon a stone bench, and faced her sullenly.</p>
    <p>"Is this how you keep your promise?" he said,
      rebukingly.</p>
    <p>"Oh, marry, I put you in no danger. I might
      have walked boldly to the doors and asked for you.
      But I lay off yonder in the boat till you came forth;
      it put me to the more cost, but you are shielded."</p>
    <p>"Well, why in God's name have you come?"</p>
    <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[154]</a></span></p>
    <p>"Because you would not come to the Grange, and
      I must needs have speech with you. You forbade
      messages."</p>
    <p>"Then have speech with me, and make an end.
      But look you, Meg, I have no money. I have kept
      my word with you; I have given you a home at the
      Grange; 'twas all I promised."</p>
    <p>"'Tis all I ask. But the place must be a home,
      not a hell. 'Tis well enough by day, and I mind not
      the loneness&#8212;troth, I'm glad to hide my shame.
      But by night 'tis fearful, with none but old Jeremy
      for protection, and he so feeble and such a coward.
      You must send a man there, you must!&#8212;a man
      that is able to use a sword and pistol, and not
      afraid."</p>
    <p>"Why, who would go so far from the highroad to
      rob such a rotten husk of a house?"</p>
    <p>"'Tis not robbers," she said, sinking her voice to
      a terrified whisper. "'Tis ghosts, and witches."</p>
    <p>Jerningham laughed in derision of the idea.</p>
    <p>"I tell you it's true. I know what I say," she
      went on. "Spirits walk there every night; there
      are such sounds&#8212;!"</p>
    <p>"Poh!" he interrupted. "The creaking of the
      timbers; the moving of the casements in the wind;
      the flapping of the arras; the gnawing and running
      of rats and mice."</p>
    <p>"'Tis more than that. There be things I see;<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_155"
          name="Page_155">[155]</a></span>
      forms that pass swiftly; they appear for a moment,
      then melt away."</p>
    <p>"'Tis in your dreams you see them."</p>
    <p>"I know when I am awake; besides, often I see
      them when I am not abed."</p>
    <p>"They are the tricks of moonlight, then; or of
      rays that steal in at cracks and crevices; or they
      are the moving of arras and such in a faint breeze."</p>
    <p>"I know better. Think not to put me off so.
      I'll not stay there alone with old Jeremy. I cannot
      bear it&#8212;such fright! Good God, what nights I've
      passed!"</p>
    <p>Jerningham quieted her with a gesture of caution,
      as he looked fearfully around to see if her excited
      manner was observed.</p>
    <p>"Then there are witches," she went on, more
      calmly. "They slink about the house and the garden
      in the shape of cats. Terrible noises they make at
      night."</p>
    <p>"Why, they <i>are</i> cats, like enough; they seek the
      rats and mice. Troth, for horrible noises&#8212;"</p>
    <p>"Nay, but I know better. T'other evening Jeremy
      was late fetching home the cow from the field, and
      so when I had done milking 'twas near nightfall.
      As I was crossing the yard with the milk, what did
      I see but an old woman leaning on her stick, by the
      corner of the house. She was chewing and mumbling,
      and looking straight at me. I saw 'twas old<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_156"
          name="Page_156">[156]</a></span>
      Goody Banks, whom the whole countryside knows to
      be a witch."</p>
    <p>"Foh! a poor crazy beldame, no doubt come to
      beg or steal a crust or a cup of milk."</p>
    <p>"I thought so too, at first, after I had got over the
      fright of seeing her&#8212;for 'tis rare we ever see any
      one at the Grange. But as I was going to speak
      to her, she looked at me so evilly I remembered what
      the countryfolk say of her, and such a fright came
      over me again, I cried out, 'Avaunt in the name of
      Jesus!' and flung the pail of milk at her. I heard
      a kind of whisk,&#8212;for I had closed my eyes as I
      threw,&#8212;and when I opened them, there, instead of
      the old woman, stood a great cat, staring at me
      with the very same evil eyes! So I knew she must
      be a witch&#8212;turning into a cat before my very eyes!"</p>
    <p>"But your eyes were closed, you say."</p>
    <p>"Ay, she had bewitched me to close 'em, no doubt,
      so I might not see how she transformed herself."</p>
    <p>"Why, 'tis all clear. The whisk you heard was
      of the old woman's running away from the milk-pail.
      The cat had been there all the while, belike, but you
      had not seen it for the old woman."</p>
    <p>"I tell you I know what I saw," she replied, growing
      vehement again. "You need not think to fool
      me, and turn me off. Sith you have no other place
      for me to live, I am content to live at the Grange;
      but you must send a man there to guard the place<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_157"
          name="Page_157">[157]</a></span>
      against ghosts and witches. You must do it,&#8212;a
      stout, strong man afraid of nothing; no shivering old
      dotard like Jeremy, who durs'n't stick his nose out of
      his bedclothes between dusk and daybreak. You
      promised to give me a home, and I to keep silent and
      unseen; but a house of spirits and witches is no fit
      home, and so what becomes of our agreement? So
      best send a man."</p>
    <p>"Why, if it be not possible?"</p>
    <p>"Then I shall hold myself freed of my promise,
      and if you cannot make one place a home for me, you
      shall make another. I shall tell the bishop all that
      is between us&#8212;oh, I shall get word to him, doubt it
      not!&#8212;and I know what so good a man will do. He
      will make you marry me, that is what he will! My
      birth&#8212;"</p>
    <p>"Oh, peace! I was jesting. I will send a man.
      Is that all?"</p>
    <p>"Ay, and little enough. There's much a man can
      do there, for the good of the place itself. Will you
      send him to-day?"</p>
    <p>"Why, faith, if I can find him&#8212;a man fit for the
      place, I mean. I have much to do to-day."</p>
    <p>"But I cannot endure another night there, with
      none but Jeremy in the house. You must send him
      to-day; else I swear I will come&#8212;"</p>
    <p>"Nay, give me a little time," pleaded Jerningham,
      thinking that if he could but hold her off with prom<span class="pagenum"><a
          id="Page_158" name="Page_158">[158]</a></span>ises
      for two days, her disclosure would matter little, as
      by that time he would be afloat&#8212;unless weather
      should hinder the sailing. At this "unless," he
      frowned, and remembered the fortune-teller's prediction.
      Without doubt, what Mistress Meg might do
      was the obstacle in the case. He entertained a morbid
      fear of an impediment arising at the last moment.
      The woman was capable of keeping her threat; and
      the bishop was capable of staying him at the very
      lifting of the anchor, capable even of having him pursued
      and brought back as long as he was in home
      waters. Meg knew nothing of his voyage. He must
      keep that from her, as well as satisfy her in the matter
      of her request. The wise man had said that "prudence"
      might avoid the obstacle; Jerningham must
      deal prudently with her. "I will send a man next
      week," quoth he.</p>
    <p>"I will give you till to-morrow to find a fit man,"
      she replied, resolutely. "To-night I can sit up with
      candles lit. But if your man be not there to-morrow
      at four o'clock in the afternoon, I shall start for
      London; if I come a-horseback I can be here by
      eight."</p>
    <p>Jerningham fetched a heavy sigh. He knew this
      woman, and when she meant what she said, and how
      impossible it was to move her on those occasions.
      He thought what a close player his adverse fiend
      was, to set the time of her possible revelation upon<span class="pagenum"><a
          id="Page_159" name="Page_159">[159]</a></span>
      the very eve of his departure. Durst he hazard
      some very probable hitch of her causing? No; that
      would not be "prudence." He must not only
      promise her; he must also send the man. After all,
      that was no difficult matter; once the master was
      safe away on the seas, destined to come back rich
      enough to defy bishop and all, or come back never
      at all, let the man look where he might for his wage.
      It was but palming off upon her the first ruffian to
      be hired, who might behave decently for a week
      or so.</p>
    <p>Jerningham's face lightened, therefore; he gave
      his word, slipped the woman a coin to pay her boatman,
      saw her to the boat by which she had come,
      and then took his seat in the one awaiting him, and
      bade the waterman make haste to the Temple stairs.</p>
    <p>As he and Gregory walked into the Temple
      church, he did not immediately know the man who
      hastened up to meet him; for the up-turned moustaches,
      and the bareness of chin, except for the
      little tuft beneath the lip, gave the captain a somewhat
      spruce and gallant appearance, notwithstanding
      his plain attire.</p>
    <p>"God save you, sir. I thought you had changed
      your mind."</p>
    <p>"By my soul, sir&#8212;oh, 'tis Ravenshaw! 'Faith, 'tis
      you have changed your face. I was detained, against
      my will. Let's go behind that farthest pillar. Troth,<span class="pagenum"><a
          id="Page_160" name="Page_160">[160]</a></span>
      this transformation&#8212;" He broke off and eyed the
      captain narrowly, with a sudden suspicion.</p>
    <p>"A man's face is his own," said Ravenshaw,
      bluffly.</p>
    <p>"One would think you had set yourself to charm
      the ladies."</p>
    <p>"Fear not. I have no designs upon the lady you
      wot of. And now let me speak plain words. When
      I undertook your business yesterday, 'twas left in
      doubt between us whether your desire of this maid
      meant honestly."</p>
    <p>"'Slight, it shall remain in doubt, as far as your
      knowledge is concerned," replied Jerningham, quickly,
      nettled at the other's tone.</p>
    <p>"It was left in doubt, as far as speech went,"
      continued Ravenshaw. "But there was little doubt
      in my mind. And yet I bound myself to the service
      because I was at war with womankind. I thought
      all women bad&#8212;nay, in my true heart I knew
      better, but I lost sight of that knowledge, and chose
      to think them so."</p>
    <p>"Wherein does your opinion of the sex concern
      me?"</p>
    <p>"But I was wrong," pursued the captain. "I
      have met one who proves they are not all bad. I
      were a fool, then, to hold myself at feud with the
      sex; and the greater fool to pay back my grudge, if
      I must pay it, upon one that is innocent."</p>
    <p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_161" name="Page_161">[161]</a></span></p>
    <p>"Why, thou recreant knave! Do you mean you
      have failed in the business and would lay it to your
      virtue?"</p>
    <p>"Softly, good sir! I will tell you this: I can win
      the maid to meet you, if I will."</p>
    <p>"Then what the devil&#8212;? How much money&#8212;?
      Come to an end, that I may know whether to use
      you or&#8212;"</p>
    <p>"I will win the maid to meet you&#8212;if you will
      pledge yourself&#8212;"</p>
    <p>"Go on; what price?"</p>
    <p>"If you will pledge yourself to make her your
      wife at the meeting, and acknowledge her openly as
      such."</p>
    <p>Jerningham stared for a moment in amazement.
      Then he gave a harsh laugh.</p>
    <p>"A rare jest, i' faith! The roaring captain, desiring
      a city maid for his mistress, offers to get her a
      gentleman husband! A shrewd captain! Belike,
      a shrewd maid, rather!"</p>
    <p>"By this hand, I ought to send you to hell! But
      for her sake, I will rather explain. She seeks no
      husband. But I conceived you might be a fit man
      for such a maid. You are young and well-favoured,&#8212;a
      fitter man than some that might be forced upon
      her. I thought a marriage with such a mate might
      save&#8212; But to the point: if you love her, why not
      honestly? And if honestly, why not in marriage?<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_162"
          name="Page_162">[162]</a></span>
      You will behold few maids as beautiful, none more
      innocent. As to her portion, the marriage must
      needs be against her father's knowledge, by license
      and bond; but when he finds his son is so likely a
      gentleman, I warrant&#8212;"</p>
    <p>"Come, come, an end of this; I am not to be
      coney-catched. Shall I meet the wench through
      your mediation, or shall I not?"</p>
    <p>"You shall not. And I tell you this: she is not
      to be won to such a meeting as you are minded for;
      not by the forms of gods, the treasures of kings, or
      the tongues of poets!"</p>
    <p>Jerningham shrugged his shoulders.</p>
    <p>"It is the truth," said the captain. "Virtue beats
      in her heart, modesty courses with her blood, purity
      shines in her eyes, she is the mirror of innocence.
      Should you find means to try her, I swear to you
      the attempt would but mar her peace, and serve you
      nothing. Nay, even if that were not so,&#8212;if there
      were a chance of your enticing her,&#8212;black curses
      would fall upon the man by whose deed that stainless
      flower were smirched. Innocence robed in beauty&#8212;there's
      too little of it walks the world, that
      gentlemen should take a hand in spoiling it!"</p>
    <p>"Man, you waste my time prating," said Jerningham,
      who had been thinking swiftly, and imagining
      many possibilities, and hence saw reason for calm
      speaking. "I see you are stubborn against the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_163"
          name="Page_163">[163]</a></span>
      business I bespoke you for. When I want an orator
      to recommend me a wife, I may seek you. If I wish
      to hear sermons out of church, I can go to Paul's
      Cross any day."</p>
    <p>The two looked at each other searchingly. The
      captain sought to find why Jerningham, after his
      exceeding desire, should show but a momentary
      anger, and speedily turn indifferent. Had his desire
      melted at a single disappointment? Perhaps; but
      affairs would bear watching. On Jerningham's part,
      he was wondering what the other would really be at,
      concerning the maid; what had passed between
      them, and how far the captain stood in the way of
      Jerningham's possessing her by such desperate means
      as might yet be used. If the man could only be
      kept unsuspecting, and got out of London for a few
      days! Jerningham had a thought.</p>
    <p>"So let us say no more of this maid," he resumed,
      "and if you forget her as soon as I shall, she will be
      soon forgot. No doubt you remember I spoke of
      other employments I might have for you. Of course
      I meant if you served me well with the goldsmith's
      wench. You proved a frail staff to lean upon in
      that matter, but I perceive 'tis no fair test of you
      where a woman is in the case. So, as you are a man
      to my liking, I will try you in another business. By
      the foot of a soldier, it cuts my heart to see men of
      mettle hounded by ill fortune!"</p>
    <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[164]</a></span></p>
    <p>So soft and urbane had Master Jerningham suddenly
      grown, so tender and courteous was his voice,
      so sweet a smile had transformed his melancholy
      face, that the captain was disarmed. All the gentleman
      in Ravenshaw seemed to be touched by the
      other's manner; he would have felt graceless and
      churlish to resist.</p>
    <p>"If the business be one that goes less against my
      stomach, I will show my thanks in it," said he, in
      conciliated tones.</p>
    <p>"'Tis a kind of stewardship over a little estate
      I have in Kent&#8212;if you mind not going to the
      country."</p>
    <p>"Say on!" quoth the captain, opening his eyes at
      the beneficent prospect.</p>
    <p>Master Jerningham depicted his small inheritance
      of neglected fields and crazy house in as favourable
      colours as he could safely use. The captain, dissembling
      not his satisfaction, averred he could wear
      the gold chain of stewardship as well as another man.
      An agreement was struck upon the spot; Jerningham
      imparted the general details, and said he would
      have the necessary writings made, and full instructions
      drawn up, within a few days; meanwhile, he
      desired the new steward to install himself in the
      house at once.</p>
    <p>"Marry, a bite and a sup, and I am ready," cried
      Ravenshaw, gaily; then suddenly remembered his<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_165"
          name="Page_165">[165]</a></span>
      promise to meet the goldsmith's daughter that evening.
      "Nay, I forgot; I have some affairs to settle.
      I cannot go before to-morrow."</p>
    <p>Jerningham, whose purpose had been so happily
      met by the captain's readiness, lost his gratified
      look.</p>
    <p>"Oh, a plague on your affairs! You must go
      to-day," he said.</p>
    <p>Ravenshaw shook his head. "I cannot go till
      to-morrow, and there's an end on't!"</p>
    <p>Jerningham sighed with suppressed vexation. He
      dared not urge lest he arouse suspicion. It was too
      late to back out of the bargain without betraying
      himself. Moreover, to get the captain away on the
      morrow was better than nothing.</p>
    <p>"Well, well; look to your affairs, then. But go
      early to-morrow."</p>
    <p>Ravenshaw pondered a few moments. "I will
      start at noon, not before."</p>
    <p>"But you must be at the Grange by four o'clock;
      I have given my word to the people there."</p>
    <p>"I can do so, setting forth at noon. 'Tis eighteen
      miles, you say. I will go by horse."</p>
    <p>"'Slight, man, have you a horse?"</p>
    <p>"No, but you will give me one&#8212;or the means
      to buy one at Smithfield; and then may I die in
      Newgate if I be not at your country-house at four
      o'clock!"</p>
    <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[166]</a></span></p>
    <p>After a little thought, Jerningham told him to call
      at a certain gate at Winchester House on the morrow
      at noon, where a horse would be in waiting; he then
      handed him a gold angel and dismissed him to his
      affairs.</p>
    <p>The captain had no sooner strutted jauntily off
      than Jerningham quickly beckoned Gregory, and said
      earnestly:</p>
    <p>"Dog his footsteps. Lose not his track till he
      comes to me to-morrow; and if he meets <i>her</i>&#8212;Begone!
      you will lose him. Haste!"</p>
    <p>The jealous lackey, raised to sudden joy by this
      congenial commission, glided away like a cat.</p>
    <p>"I will have her, 'gainst all the surly fathers and
      swaggering captains in London; and 'gainst her own
      will, and fiends and angels, to boot!" said Master
      Jerningham, in his heart.</p>
    <p>About the same moment, Ravenshaw was saying
      in <i>his</i> heart, as he trod the stones of Fleet Street:</p>
    <p>"Ere I leave London, I'll see her safe from the
      old man's hopes and the young man's devices. I'll
      pawn my brains, else!"</p>

    </blockquote>
    <p>Ravenshaw found Master Holyday leaning back
      against a door-post, with the unconscious weariness
      of hunger, and listening with a mild interest to the
      oration of a quack doctor who had drawn a small
      crowd.</p>
    <p>"Come, heart," cried the captain, "the mountebank
      will never cure thy empty stomach; here's the
      remedy for that," and he showed his gold piece, and
      dragged the scholar to an ordinary. After dinner,
      they bought paper, ink, and pens, and took a lodging
      at the house of a horse-courser in Smithfield,&#8212;a

      with the Mad, Merry Humours of the Foul-mouthed
      Roaring Greek Soldier, Thersites."</p>
    <p>The captain whiled away the afternoon in the
      streets, where there were conjurers, jugglers, morris-dancers,
      monsters, and all manner of shows for the
      crowds of people in town for the law term. At
      evening he took home a supper from a cook's shop,
      and shared it with Holyday, who, being in the full
      flow of inspiration, continued writing with one hand
      while he ate from the other whatever the captain
      offered him; the poet knowing not what food he
      took, and oft staring or grimacing as he sought for
      expression or felt the passion or mirth of what he
      wrote. Ravenshaw presently placed a lighted candle
      on the writer's deal table, and stole out to keep his
      tryst with the goldsmith's daughter.</p>
    <p>The day had gone eventfully at the goldsmith's
      house. In the morning Master Etheridge announced
      that he would give a supper, with dancing,
      that night, to show his pleasure at Sir Peregrine's
      recovery and arrival. This was an age when rich
      citizens missed no occasion for festivity. So there
      was much bustle of sending servants with invitations,
      hiring a band of musicians, cooking meats and
      fowls and birds, making cakes and marchpane and
      pasties, and other doings. Millicent uttered no
      plaint or protest; the time of pleadings and tears
      on her side, arguments and threats on her father's,<span class="pagenum"><a
          id="Page_169" name="Page_169">[169]</a></span>
      was past; many and long had been the scenes
      between the two, such as were not uncommon in
      that age, and such as Shakespeare has represented
      in the brief passage between "Juliet" and her
      parents, and these had left the goldsmith firm as
      rock, Millicent weak and hopeless of resisting his
      will.</p>
    <p>As for Sir Peregrine, he had never thought it
      necessary to urge; he took it for granted she adored
      him&#8212;what lady had not?&#8212;and that in her heart
      she counted herself supremely blessed in being
      picked out for him. He attributed her aloofness
      and sulkiness, even her outbursts of spoken detestation,
      to shyness, girlish perverseness, sense of unworthiness
      of the honour of his hand, and chiefly to
      jealousy of his former wives and present admirers.
      So he serenely ignored all signs of her feelings.</p>
    <p>She bore her part in the day's preparations, a little
      uneasy in mind lest the festivities might prevent her
      appointed meeting at nightfall. She could not help
      counting much upon this new acquaintance; he
      seemed a man of such resource and ingenuity, and
      such willingness to deliver her, even though he was
      betrothed to another&#8212;what a pity he was betrothed!
      She checked herself, with a blush; but all the same
      she had an intuition that the other woman would not
      be the best wife for him.</p>
    <p>So it befell that, as Ravenshaw approached the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_170"
          name="Page_170">[170]</a></span>
      house at dark, he saw all the windows light, and
      from the open ones came forth the sounds of music,
      laughter, and gay voices. Nevertheless, he pushed
      gently at the Friday Street gate, which gave as he
      had hoped, and found himself alone in the garden.
      He softly closed the gate, went into the shadow of
      the apple-tree, and waited.</p>
    <p>With his eyes upon the place where she must
      appear in coming from the house, he listened to
      the music of a stately dance,&#8212;the thin but elegant
      and spirit-like music of the time, produced on
      this occasion by violins, flutes, and shawms. When
      the strains died, they were soon followed by bursts
      of laughter from the open dining-room windows;
      then, presently, in the moonlight, he saw the figure
      he awaited. With a golden caul upon her head,
      and wearing the long robe and train necessary to
      the majestic pavan which she had recently been
      dancing, she glided across the turf, and stopped
      before him.</p>
    <p>"You have come from great mirth," whispered
      the captain, looking toward the windows whence the
      laughter proceeded.</p>
    <p>"It enabled me to escape," she whispered in
      reply. "They are listening to the tales of one
      Master Vallance; he has been telling of the rogueries
      of a rascal named Ravenshaw, a disbanded captain
      that swaggers about the town."</p>
    <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[171]</a></span></p>
    <p>He stared at her, with open eyes and limp jaw; in
      a vague way he remembered one Master Vallance
      as a gallant who had insulted him one night in the
      Windmill tavern, the night he first met Master Holyday.
      Luckily, she did not notice his expression.</p>
    <p>"As for me," she finished, "I think no better
      of gentlemen like Master Vallance for knowing such
      foul knaves."</p>
    <p>"Ay, indeed," assented the captain.</p>
    <p>"They are holding these little revels in welcome
      to Sir Peregrine," she went on. "You might have
      been invited, but I heard my father say he forgot
      where you lodged, if you told him."</p>
    <p>"'Tis better to be here, at your invitation."</p>
    <p>"Then I bid you welcome," she said, smiling,
      and holding out her hand.</p>
    <p>"Faith, a right courteous maid," said he, and
      took the least motion as if to touch the hand with
      his lips; but thought what he was, and stood rigid.
      "Well, we must talk now of your&#8212;"</p>
    <p>"Good heaven! Stand close behind the tree,"
      she whispered. "'Tis Sir Peregrine, come after me."</p>
    <p>Ravenshaw was instantly under cover. Sure
      enough, steps were shuffling along the sod, and
      a cracked old voice approached, saying:</p>
    <p>"What, what, sweet? Wilt fly me still? wilt be
      still peevish? Nay, good lack, I perceive it now;
      thou knew'st I'd follow; thou wished to be alone with<span class="pagenum"><a
          id="Page_172" name="Page_172">[172]</a></span>
      me, alone with thy chick. A pretty thought; I'll
      kiss thee for it."</p>
    <p>Ravenshaw heard the smack of the old man's
      lips, and grated his teeth. She had stepped toward
      the knight, so as to meet him at a further distance
      from her secret visitor, of whom, manifestly, the old
      fellow's eyes had not caught a glimpse.</p>
    <p>What was she to do? To send the interrupter
      back into the house upon a pretext was to be rid of
      him but a minute. She was not born to craft, or
      schooled in it; but her situation of late had sharpened
      her wits and altered her scruples. Ravenshaw,
      straining his ears, heard her say:</p>
    <p>"I am angry with you, Sir Peregrine, and that
      is why I came away."</p>
    <p>"What, angry, my bird, with thy faithfullest,
      ever-lovingest servant? Be I to blame if Mistress
      Felton smiled so at me?"</p>
    <p>"Oh, Mistress Felton?&#8212;let her smile, I care
      not. I am angry because of thy gift. A goodly
      gift enough, and more than I deserve; but when
      you knew my heart was set upon the sapphire in
      your Italian bonnet&#8212;"</p>
    <p>"Why, God's love, you never said you wished
      it! Sure, how&#8212;"</p>
    <p>"Never said, with my lips, no doubt. But have I
      not said with my eyes, gazing on it by the hour?
      Troth, art grown so blind&#8212;?"</p>
    <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[173]</a></span></p>
    <p>"Oh, good lack, say no more, sweet! The sapphire
      is thine own; I'll fetch it to-morrow."</p>
    <p>"Nay, but I wish it to-night, long for it to-night,
      must have it to-night; else I shall hate it, and never
      desire it, and throw it to a coal-carrier when you
      fetch it!"</p>
    <p>"God-a-mercy! thou shalt have it to-night. 'Tis
      at mine inn; I'll send one of my men straightway."</p>
    <p>"What, trust it to thy man? Such a jewel, that
      I have set my heart on? If he were to lose it,
      or be robbed of it, I should ne'er&#8212;"</p>
    <p>"Oh, fear not. Humphrey is to be trusted;
      he hath served me fifty&#8212;ah&#8212;twenty year, come
      Michaelmas; he'll fetch it safe."</p>
    <p>"Oh, well, then, if you fear to go alone for it after
      dark!&#8212;if you choose not to make a lover's errand
      of it!&#8212;if you are too old, why, then&#8212;"</p>
    <p>"Oh, tush, I'll go for it! Too old! ha, ha!
      Thou'rt a jesting chick, thou art. See how soon
      I shall fetch it."</p>
    <p>He strutted to the gate, and was gone. In
      a moment, Millicent was by Ravenshaw's side;
      neither of the two thinking to fasten the gate
      after the knight's departure.</p>
    <p>"I see we must be quick," said Ravenshaw.
      "Your only escape from this marriage is to run
      away from it. Your only refuge, you once thought,<span class="pagenum"><a
          id="Page_174" name="Page_174">[174]</a></span>
      was your uncle's house. But now that seems closed
      to you."</p>
    <p>"I am not sure. My uncle wrote me so, when
      he was fresh from his mishap in London. But
      if he found me at his door, he might not have
      the heart to thrust me away."</p>
    <p>"No doubt; but your father would seek you at
      your uncle's. You think you could be hid there;
      but if your father is the man he seems, and your
      uncle is the man <i>he</i> seems, your father would soon
      have you out of hiding; he would have the house
      down, else. Is it not so?"</p>
    <p>"Perchance you are right; alas!"</p>
    <p>"Now there is a way whereby it may be possible
      for you to find refuge elsewhere; or whereby you
      may e'en go to your uncle's and defy your father
      when he comes after you."</p>
    <p>"In God's name, what is it?"</p>
    <p>"Troth, have you ne'er thought on't? If you
      were already married&#8212;but not to Sir Peregrine or
      any such kind of stockfish&#8212;might not your husband
      take you to his own house? or if he took you to
      your uncle's, what good were your father's claim
      upon you against your husband's?"</p>
    <p>She looked at him timidly but sweetly, and trembled
      a little.</p>
    <p>"What?" quoth she, with pretended gaiety. "Escape
      a husband by seeking a husband?"</p>
    <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[175]</a></span></p>
    <p>"By accepting, not seeking, one&#8212;one less unfit&#8212;one
      that a maid might find to her liking."</p>
    <p>"Why, in good sooth&#8212;I hope I am not a bold
      hussy for saying so&#8212;but rather than be bound to
      that odious Sir Peregrine, I think I would choose
      blindfold any husband that offered! And if he were,
      as you say, to my liking&#8212;"</p>
    <p>"I said he might be to the liking of some maids.
      Have you ever considered what manner of man your
      fancy might rest upon?"</p>
    <p>He covered the seriousness of the question with
      a feigned merriment. She, too, wore a smile; in
      her confusion, she fingered the low-hanging apple-blossoms,
      and avoided his eyes, but, watching him
      furtively, she noticed how familiarly his hand reposed
      on his sword-hilt; ere she bethought herself, she answered:</p>
    <p>"Oh, a man of good wit, a better wit than face,
      and yet a middling good face, too; a man that could
      handle a rapier well&#8212;yes, certainly a good swordman;
      and as for&#8212;"</p>
    <p>A voice was suddenly heard from the dining-room
      window aloft:</p>
    <p>"Millicent! What do you in the garden, child?
      Sure 'tis thy train I see on the grass. What dost
      thou behind the apple-tree?"</p>
    <p>It was the girl's mother,&#8212;Ravenshaw dared not
      look from behind the tree, but he knew the voice.</p>
    <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[176]</a></span></p>
    <p>"Say you are with Sir Peregrine," he whispered.</p>
    <p>With a trembling voice, she obeyed.</p>
    <p>"Oh!" exclaimed Mistress Etheridge, satisfied;
      but then, as with a suddenly engendered doubt, "I
      should have thought Sir Peregrine would speak for
      himself."</p>
    <p>"Oh, heaven!" whispered Millicent; "she will
      send down to see."</p>
    <p>"Good lack, sweet mother!" cried Ravenshaw, in
      well-nigh perfect imitation of Sir Peregrine's cracked
      voice, "may not young lovers steal away for a tender
      minute or so? May not doves coo in a corner unseen?
      Must sweethearts be called from a quiet
      bower, and made to show themselves, and to give
      answers?"</p>
    <p>"Peace, peace, Sir Peregrine! I am much to
      blame," replied Mistress Etheridge; and went away
      from the window, as Millicent observed in peeping
      around the apple-tree.</p>
    <p>"Faith," whispered Ravenshaw, "lest we be overheard,
      I should speak love to you in his voice henceforth."</p>
    <p>"Nay, I'd rather you spoke it in your own voice,"
      said Millicent, ere she realised.</p>
    <p>Ravenshaw's heart bounded.</p>
    <p>"'Slight, what fool's talk!" she added, quickly, in
      chagrin. "I do indeed forget the other maid!"</p>
    <p>"What other maid?" he asked, off his guard.</p>
    <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[177]</a></span></p>
    <p>"The maid you are to marry, of course."</p>
    <p>"Oh!&#8212;faith, yes, I forgot her, too!" he answered,
      truly enough.</p>
    <p>"Fie, Master Holyday!" she said, pride bidding
      her assume the mask of raillery.</p>
    <p>"Holyday, say you?" called out an insolent, derisive
      voice, at which both Ravenshaw and Millicent
      started in surprise, for it came from within the
      garden. A moment later, a head was thrust forth
      from the shrubbery by the gate,&#8212;the head of Master
      Jerningham's man Gregory, who had patiently
      hounded Ravenshaw all afternoon and evening, and
      had slipped in when Sir Peregrine had left the gate
      unclosed.</p>
    <p>"Holyday, forsooth!" he went on, instantly alive
      to the opportunity of serving his master by shattering
      the falsely won confidence he saw between the
      maid and Ravenshaw. "You are cozened, mistress.
      The man's name is not Holyday; 'tis Ravenshaw&#8212;and
      a scurvy name he has made of it, too!"</p>
    <p>Astonishment and mortification had held the captain
      motionless; but now, with a sharp ejaculation,
      he flashed out his rapier, and ran for his exposer.
      But the cat-footed Gregory had as swiftly darted
      along between shrubbery and wall, and Ravenshaw,
      on reaching the place where he had appeared, had
      to stop and look about in vain for him.</p>
    <p>"What does he mean?" demanded Millicent of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_178"
          name="Page_178">[178]</a></span>
      the captain, whom she had followed. "Is your name
      Ravenshaw?"</p>
    <p>He felt that his wrathful movement against his
      accuser had confirmed the accusation; moreover,
      there was that in her look which made it too repugnant
      to deceive her longer.</p>
    <p>"I cannot deny it," he said, humbly.</p>
    <p>"What! Not <i>that</i> Ravenshaw?"</p>
    <p>"The one of whom you heard Master Vallance
      speak?&#8212;yes!"</p>
    <p>Here Gregory's voice put in again from another
      part of the shrubbery:</p>
    <p>"'Tis Ravenshaw, the roaring rascal, that calls
      himself captain, and lives by his wits and by blustering."</p>
    <p>A slight sound told that this speech was followed
      by another prudent flight behind the shrubbery.
      Ravenshaw was minded to give chase and dig the
      fellow out at all cost, but was drawn from that intention,
      and from all thought of the spy, by the look
      of horror, indignation, and loathing that had come
      over Millicent's face. He took a step toward her;
      but, with a gesture of abhorrence, she ran from him
      across the garden. Knowing not what he would say
      or do in supplication, he went after her.</p>
    <p>"Not another step!" she cried, turning upon him,
      and with the dignity of outraged trustfulness. "Go
      hence, villain, rascal, knave! Go, or I will call my<span class="pagenum"><a
          id="Page_179" name="Page_179">[179]</a></span>
      father, to have his 'prentices throw you into the
      street! Good God! to think I should have trusted
      my secrets to such an ill-famed rogue! I know not
      what your purpose was, but for once you shall fail
      in your cheateries. I'd rather wed Sir Peregrine
      Medway thrice over than be beholden to&#8212;"</p>
    <p>At this instant, and as Ravenshaw stood shrinking
      in the fire of her contempt, the unseen Gregory,
      having seized his chance for a concealed dash from
      the garden, reached the gate, and ran plump into the
      arms of Sir Peregrine, who was returning with the
      sapphire.</p>
    <p>"Good lack, what the devil's this?" exclaimed
      the ancient knight, knocked out of breath; and he
      pluckily caught Gregory by the neck, and forced
      him back into the garden.</p>
    <p>"Let him go," said Millicent, as the knight came
      forward in great amazement. "He is a knave,
      doubtless, but deserves well for unmasking this other
      knave."</p>
    <p>"What, why, 'tis Master Holyday!" said Sir
      Peregrine, quite bewildered. "Call'st thou him a
      knave? And what dost thou here, Master Holyday?
      I knew not you were invited to the revels."</p>
    <p>"'Tis no Master Holyday," said Millicent, "but
      one Captain Ravenshaw, whose name is a byword of
      the taverns; this man has declared him, and he
      denies it not. What his designs were, in passing<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_180"
          name="Page_180">[180]</a></span>
      upon my father by the name of Holyday, I know
      not."</p>
    <p>"Good lack! here's wonders and marvels! And
      how comes he to be here to-night?"</p>
    <p>Millicent hesitated. Ravenshaw spoke for the
      first time:</p>
    <p>"I came through that gate, which you were so
      careless as to leave open, Sir Peregrine; I saw you
      go, as I stood without; and what my purposes were,
      you may amuse yourself in guessing. Yonder knave,
      I perceive, followed me&#8212;"</p>
    <p>At this, Gregory, not liking the captain's tone,
      suddenly jerked from the old knight's grasp, and
      bolted out through the gate. Ravenshaw could not
      immediately pursue him, for he had been thinking
      swiftly, and had something yet to say:</p>
    <p>"My designs being foiled, and to show that I am
      a man of pleasant humour, I will e'en give you a
      word of good counsel. When you tell Master
      Etheridge how he was fooled in his friend, young
      Holyday, let him suppose you were here when I
      entered this garden; for, look you, it will show ill in
      you to have left this lady alone, and the gate open;
      and it will appear careless in her, not to have made
      sure the gate was fastened. It will seem brave in
      you, moreover, to have been here and put me to rout
      when that knave betrayed me."</p>
    <p>He paused, looking at Millicent to see whether<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_181"
          name="Page_181">[181]</a></span>
      she inwardly thanked him for saving the secret of
      her dealings with him; but, though she seemed to
      breathe a little more freely, as if she realised her
      advantage in his suggestion, she exhibited nothing
      for him but contempt; doubtless she supposed he
      had deeper motives for his advice, or that he was
      jesting.</p>
    <p>Receiving no reply from either her or Sir Peregrine,
      the captain, after waiting a moment, made a
      low bow, turned, and swaggered out through the
      gate.</p>
    <p>"No doubt 'tis wise to do as he counselled," faltered
      Millicent, in a low tone, after Sir Peregrine
      had carefully closed the gate, and as he led her to
      the house.</p>
    <p>"Ay, so I think. I would not have your father
      know you were careless, sweet. Take the sapphire,
      chick, and give me a kiss for it."</p>
    <p>As she felt his arms around her, and his moustache
      against her lip, and meditated that her last
      hope had proved worthless, she gave herself up as
      lost, and accounted herself rather a dead than a living
      person for the rest of her days.</p>
    <p>Meanwhile Captain Ravenshaw, after stumbling
      over the protruding feet of a figure that huddled
      drunkenlike in the next doorway, plunged rapidly
      on in search of Gregory; dogged at a safe distance
      by the drunkenlike figure, which, on rising from the<span class="pagenum"><a
          id="Page_182" name="Page_182">[182]</a></span>
      doorway, proved to be that of Gregory himself, firm
      upon shadowing his enemy until the latter's meeting
      with Jerningham next day.</p>
    <p>At last abandoning the quest, during which Millicent's
      whiplike words of dismissal lashed his heart all
      the while, Ravenshaw returned to a part of Friday
      Street where he could stand in solitude and see the
      light, and hear the sprightly music, that came from
      the goldsmith's windows.</p>
    <p>"Though you loathe me and cast me off," he
      whispered, looking toward the room in which she
      might be, "yet, against your knowledge, and against
      your will to be served by me, I will keep my promise,
      and save you! You may fling me forth, but you
      cannot stop me from that! Hope be with you in
      these revels, sweet; and sleep lie soft upon your
      eyelids afterward. Good night!"</p>
    <p>After a little time, he made up his mind what to
      do, and took himself off through Cheapside, the keen-eyed,
      silent-footed serving-man still upon his track.</p>

      "What shall I do? I can borrow no more of my credit: there's not any of
        my
        acquaintance, man or boy, but I have borrowed more or less of. I would I

    </blockquote>

    <p>Ravenshaw had not the slightest thought that
      he was being followed, or had been followed during
      the day. He had recognised Gregory as Jerningham's
      attendant, but he supposed Jerningham had
      sent the man, for want of a better instrument, to
      attempt what Ravenshaw himself had withdrawn
      from, or perchance to carry a letter; he thus accounted
      for the serving-man's unexpected presence
      in the garden.</p>
    <p>He knew that the knave would not succeed, even
      if he tried it, in communicating with Mistress Millicent
      that night. But doubtless further efforts would
      be made soon, and, while he felt she was proof against
      any manifest overtures against her honour, he feared
      some cunning proposal which might have a false
      appearance of honesty, and to which, in her desperate
      desire to escape from Sir Peregrine, she
      might therefore give ear. Here was additional
      reason why he must work swiftly to place her out<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_184"
          name="Page_184">[184]</a></span>
      of all danger, either on Jerningham's side or on
      Sir Peregrine's, if sufficient reason did not already
      exist in the fact that he had to leave London at
      noon the next day. The arrangement for his serving
      Master Jerningham in the country could not be
      at all affected by his passage with Jerningham's man
      in the garden. Gregory's action there must have
      been on the inspiration of the moment, and formed
      no cause of quarrel with Jerningham; while Jerningham,
      on learning that Ravenshaw had again visited
      the goldsmith's daughter, would be the more desirous
      to get him out of London.</p>
    <p>Walking out Cheapside, the captain gave final
      order to the plans he had been evolving all the
      afternoon.</p>
    <p>He first made search and question in sundry ale-houses
      and such, about Pye Corner, for Cutting
      Tom; whom at last he found in a room filled with
      tobacco smoke, where a number of suburb rascals
      and sightseeing rustics were at the moment watching
      a fantastic fellow dance to a comrade's pipe and
      tabour. From this innocent amusement, Cutting
      Tom was easily drawn into the privacy of a little
      garden attached to the place.</p>
    <p>"What cheer now?" queried Tom. "Fighting
      to be done? or coney-catching? You know I'm
      your man through sea-water and hell-fire, for a
      brace of angels or so."</p>
    <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[185]</a></span></p>
    <p>"I have a small matter afoot to-morrow night,"
      replied Ravenshaw, gruffly, "wherein I can employ
      a man like you, and three or four under him."</p>
    <p>"Troth!" said Tom, becoming consequential, "I
      have some affairs of my own to-morrow night, and
      that's the hell of it."</p>
    <p>"Then good night to you!"</p>
    <p>"Oh, stay, captain!&#8212;I had some slight business;
      but to serve you, captain&#8212;"</p>
    <p>"You bottle-ale rogue, think not to cozen me
      into a higher price. Affairs of your own!&#8212;no
      more of that. Shall we deal, or no?"</p>
    <p>"Oh, I am all yours, captain. For you, I would
      put myself out any day. Say on."</p>
    <p>"Then you are first to raise four stout fellows
      whom you can trust as you do your false dice or
      your right hand."</p>
    <p>"They are near. Trust me for 'em."</p>
    <p>"At sunset to-morrow, you and your men, all well
      armed, and furnished with lights, be in waiting before
      the White Horse tavern in Friday Street,&#8212;that is
      to say, loitering in a manner not to make people inquisitive.
      There will come to you anon a young
      gentleman&#8212;with a young woman. The gentleman
      is one you have seen. He was with me the night
      you turned tail to those counterfeit roaring boys."</p>
    <p>"I have seen him with you since,&#8212;a lean, clerkly
      man."</p>
    <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[186]</a></span></p>
    <p>"Ay; and he and the maid will pass the White
      Horse tavern, as soon after sunset as may be.
      Now, be sure you mistake not the man,&#8212;it may
      be nightfall ere they come."</p>
    <p>"Never fear. I am a man of darkness. Mine
      eyes are an old tom-cat's."</p>
    <p>"Without stopping them, you and your men will
      close around the couple as a guard, and accompany
      where the gentleman shall direct. If any pursue,
      or try to molest them, you are to defend, and help
      their flight, at all risks. But they are not like to
      be sought for till they are out of London. They
      will take to the water at Queenhithe, and you five
      with them, all in the same boat. And so down
      the river with the tide, how many miles I know
      not exactly, till you land, upon the Kentish side.
      The gentleman will give orders where."</p>
    <p>"This should be worth ten pound, at the least, so
      far," said Cutting Tom, musingly, as if to himself.</p>
    <p>"You will not get ten pounds at the most, and yet
      you will go farther," replied Ravenshaw, curtly.
      "After you are put ashore, will come your chief
      service, which is to protect my gentleman and maid
      to their destination inland. How far this journey
      will be, I am not sure, but 'twill be some walking,
      through woods and by lonely ways, and by night;
      and you are to guard them against the dangers and
      fears of the way, that is all. When they come to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_187"
          name="Page_187">[187]</a></span>
      the place they are bound for, they will dismiss
      you, and you may fare home to London as you
      choose."</p>
    <p>"Why, beshrew my body! 'tis an all-night business,
      then."</p>
    <p>"It should be over something after midnight, if
      begun early and well sped; I count not the time of
      your return to London. And look you: I am not
      to be named in the affair, that is of the first import.
      If the lady knew&#8212;well, in short, I am not to be
      named. The lady is not to know of my hand in it;
      if she did all would go wrong, and I should make
      you sorry."</p>
    <p>"I will remember. This should be worth, now,
      fifteen pound, at the smallest. I shall have to pay
      the men&#8212;"</p>
    <p>"You can pay them a pound apiece, and have
      two pounds for yourself. That will be six pounds."</p>
    <p>"Oh, jest not, I pray you! Ten pound and
      there's an end on't."</p>
    <p>After some discussion, they met each other at
      eight pounds. Then arose another question.</p>
    <p>"Since you are not to appear in the affair," said
      Cutting Tom, "and I know not the other gentleman
      save by sight, it behooves that you pay before we set
      forth."</p>
    <p>"Half ere you set forth," conceded the captain,
      knowing his man, "half when the work is done."</p>
    <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[188]</a></span></p>
    <p>"Then will the gentleman pay me the second half
      when we are at his destination?"</p>
    <p>"No. He will have no money with him. I would
      not put you in temptation upon the journey, or afterward.
      Though I shall not appear in the matter, I
      shall pay." He thought for a moment. It was
      safest that Cutting Tom should know him alone as
      master, deal with him alone where gold was to be
      handled, and yet that he should not pay the first
      money till the last possible moment before leaving
      London. Finally he said: "For the first four
      pounds, thus: to-morrow, at fifteen minutes before
      noon, no later, be at the hither end of London
      Bridge; I will meet you there and pay. For the
      other four pounds, thus: when the journey is finished,
      pass the rest of the night at the gentleman's
      destination,&#8212;he shall find you room in some stable-loft,
      or such,&#8212;and there I will come the next day
      with the gold, for I shall be in that neighbourhood."</p>
    <p>Cutting Tom grumbled a little; but Ravenshaw,
      after applying to him a few terms designed to make
      him think no better of himself, threatened to employ
      another man, and so brought him to agreement.
      The details having been repeated for the sake of
      accuracy, the captain left the place, and Tom
      returned to his amusements.</p>
    <p>Ravenshaw's concern now was to raise the promised
      eight pounds and such other money as would be<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_189"
          name="Page_189">[189]</a></span>
      required in the exploit. He must needs bestir himself.
      At this late hour there was not time for any
      elaborate enterprise. Some bold, shrewd stroke
      must serve him. But might he expect to perform
      such a wonder now, when he had not been able to
      perform one, even at the pressure of dire want, during
      the past weeks? Yes; for he had the stimulus
      of a new motive; and the very shortness of the time
      at his disposal would put an edge to his wit, and
      sharpen his sight to opportunities to which he would
      commonly be blind.</p>
    <p>The manifest thing to do first was to stake his few
      shillings at cards or dice. He entered the nearest
      dice-house; but here he was well known and no
      player would engage with him. He went into another
      place, where most of the gamesters were men
      from the country, whom a few hardened rooks of the
      town were fleecing. Here the captain got to work
      with the bones; but, as the dice were true, he soon,
      to his consternation, lost his last sixpence. In a
      desperate desire of getting some silver back in order
      to try for better luck elsewhere, he raised a howl of
      having been cheated with loaded dice, and proceeded
      to roar terror into his opponent. But the latter,
      frightened out of his wits, took bodily flight, and,
      though Ravenshaw pursued him out of the house,
      succeeded in losing himself in the darkness of Snow
      Hill.</p>
    <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[190]</a></span></p>
    <p>What was the captain now to do? For a moment
      he thought of taking his stand on Holborn bridge,
      and crying "Deliver!" to the first belated person
      who might be supposed to carry a fat purse. But
      there would be danger in that course, danger to his
      purpose, and he dared not risk that purpose as he
      would risk his own neck. He bethought himself
      with bitterness that there was not a human being in
      London, or in the world, who would lend him half
      the needed sum, to save his soul. Nerved by the
      reflection, he strode forward and swaggered into a
      tavern on the north side of Holborn, the door of
      which had just opened to let out three hilarious inns-of-court
      men who came forth singing:</p>
<div class="poetry-container">
  <div class="poetry">
    <div class="stanza">
      <div class="verse">"For three merry men, and three merry men,</div>
      <div class="verse">And three merry men we be."</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>
    <p>He looked in at each open chamber door, and
      listened at each closed one. Neither eating, nor
      drinking, nor smoking, nor the music of begging
      fiddlers, had any attraction for him this time. But
      at last he came to a large upper room wherein money
      was passing, for he could hear the rattle of dice and
      the soft chink of gold amidst the exclamations of
      men, the voices of women, and the scraping of a
      couple of violins. Without knocking, he boldly
      flung open the door, and entered.</p>
    <p>Candles were plentiful in the room, which was<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_191"
          name="Page_191">[191]</a></span>
      hung with painted cloth. On a long table were
      the remains of a supper; at one end of this table
      the cloth had been turned back, and three gentlemen
      were throwing dice upon the bare oak. At the
      other part of the table sat two women, with painted
      cheeks and gorgeous gowns, and a fourth gentleman.
      Upon the window-seat were two vagabond-looking
      fellows a-fiddling. The women were dividing their
      attention between the gamesters and a lean greyhound,
      for which they would toss occasionally a bit of
      food into the air. Before each of the women there
      was a little pile of gold, to which her particular gamester
      would add or resort, as he won or lost. All this
      the captain took in with sharp eyes ere any one did
      him the honour to challenge his entrance with a look.</p>
    <p>"Oh, your pardon!" quoth he, when at last these
      people showed a kind of careless, insolent surprise at
      his presence. "I thought to find friends here; I
      have mistaken the room." But instead of withdrawing
      he stepped forward, his glance playing between
      the dice and the gold.</p>
    <p>"Oh, Jesu!" said one of the women, a great lazy
      blonde, with splendid eyes, and a slow voice; "'tis
      that swaggering filthy rascal Ravenshaw, with his
      beard cut off."</p>
    <p>"'Tis Samson shorn of his strength, then!" said
      the other woman, a little, Spanish-looking, brown
      beauty, who spoke in quick, shrill tones. She was<span class="pagenum"><a
          id="Page_192" name="Page_192">[192]</a></span>
      dressed in brown velvet and scarlet satin. One of
      her hands lay in the ardent clasp of a large gentleman,
      who, with his own free hand, held the dice-box.
      He was handsome and simple-looking, and he now
      broke into loud laughter at her jest.</p>
    <p>"'Twould have needed a handsomer Delilah than
      any here, to do the shearing," said the captain, rudely.
      Having been a hater of women, he had been wont to
      treat this kind with caustic raillery.</p>
    <p>The large gallant roared at this, and said, "Faith,
      ladies, you brought that on yourselves!" But
      one of the other two gamesters, a lean, fox-faced,
      eager-looking little man, he whose pile of winnings
      lay before the indolent blonde, frowned with resentment
      on her behalf. First his frown was directed
      at Ravenshaw; but, deeming it prudent to aim it
      elsewhere, he turned it upon the large gentleman,
      saying:</p>
    <p>"Your mirth is easily stirred, Master Burney."</p>
    <p>The brunette shot a look of anger at the speaker
      for the offensive tone he used toward her gallant.
      The blonde noticed this, and took the little gentleman's
      hand in hers, to show where her allegiance
      lay; and then she drawled out, with a motion which
      might have come to a shrug of horror had she not
      been too lazy to finish it:</p>
    <p>"Oh, God! I pity Delilah, the poor woman, if her
      Samson was such a bottle-ale rogue as this beast!"</p>
    <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[193]</a></span></p>
    <p>Master Burney laughed at this sally, and somewhat
      reinstated himself in the favour of the little gallant.</p>
    <p>Ravenshaw bowed low. "I salute your most
      keen, subtle, elegant, biting wit, Lady Greensleeves!
      It cuts; oh, it cuts!"</p>
    <p>"'Lady Greensleeves!' Ho, ho, ho!" bawled
      Master Burney, and forthwith essayed to sing, with
      a tunelessness the worse for the opposition of the
      fiddlers, some lines of the familiar ballad:</p>
<div class="poetry-container">
  <div class="poetry">
    <div class="stanza">
      <div class="verse">"Greensleeves was all my joy,</div>
      <div class="verse">Greensleeves was my delight;</div>
      <div class="verse">Greensleeves was my heart of gold,</div>
      <div class="verse">And who but Lady Greensleeves?"</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>
    <p>The point of the nickname lay in the fact that the
      pink silk gown which encased the large, shapely figure
      of the lady&#8212;a gown so cut as to reveal an ample
      surface of bust&#8212;was fitted with sleeves of light
      green.</p>
    <p>"Christ! what caterwauling!" quoth Lady Greensleeves,
      with a smile, not ill-naturedly.</p>
    <p>"'Tis not as bad as his laughing, at worst," said
      her gallant.</p>
    <p>"What is amiss with his laughing?" spoke up the
      brunette, pressing Master Burney's hand the more
      tightly.</p>
    <p>"Oh," replied the little gallant, "I find no fault
      that he laughs; but 'tis the manner of his laugh. If<span class="pagenum"><a
          id="Page_194" name="Page_194">[194]</a></span>
      he but laughed like a Christian, I should not mind.
      But he laughs like a&#8212;like a&#8212;"</p>
    <p>"Like a what?" persisted the brunette, defiantly.</p>
    <p>"Like a pig," said Lady Greensleeves, placidly.</p>
    <p>The brunette's eyes flashed at the fair woman, but
      the latter's amiable, half-smiling look disarmed wrath,
      or seemed to put it in the wrong, and so for a
      moment nobody spoke. Meanwhile Ravenshaw had
      made these swift deductions: Here was one gentleman
      prone to laugh at anything; there was another
      gentleman quick to take offence at that laughter if it
      was directed against his mistress; neither gentleman
      was afraid of the other, but both were afraid of
      Ravenshaw, whose name gave him a fine isolation,
      making it as hard for him to find adversaries in fight
      as in gaming; and each gentleman was adored by his
      lady. In a flash, the captain saw what might be made
      out of the situation.</p>
    <p>"How is it you knew who I was, Lady Greensleeves?"
      he asked. "I think, if I had ever met you,
      I should have remembered you."</p>
    <p>"Oh, lord! I would not for a thousand pound rub
      against all the scurvy stuff that's in your memory!
      I was in Paris Garden the day you killed the bear
      that got loose among the people, and that is how I
      learned who you were. And oft since then I have
      seen you hanging about tavern doors, as I have gone
      about the town in my coach. I think I have seen<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_195"
          name="Page_195">[195]</a></span>
      you at prison windows, hanging down a box for
      pennies, but I'm not sure."</p>
    <p>This time Master Burney's laugh was upon the
      captain, and all joined in it.</p>
    <p>"No doubt," said Ravenshaw; "and I think you
      once put a penny in the box, but when I drew it
      up I found it was a bad one."</p>
    <p>"Troth, then," she said, "here's a good coin to
      make up for it." And she took up the smallest piece
      of gold from the pile in front of her, and threw it
      toward him. "Take it, and buy stale prunes to keep
      up your stale valour!"</p>
    <p>"Nay," he retorted, throwing it back; "keep it,
      and buy stale paint to keep up your stale beauty!"</p>
    <p>Master Burney's shout of mirth was cut short by a
      curse, and a slap in the face, both from Lady Greensleeves's
      lover, who had leaped to his feet and was
      the picture of fury. The struck man, with a loud
      roar of anger, sprang up instantly; and both had
      their rapiers in hand in a moment.</p>
    <p>The two other gentlemen and the brunette rushed
      in to keep the angry gallants asunder; Lady Greensleeves
      sat like one helpless, and began to scream like
      a frightened child; the fiddlers broke off their tune
      of a sudden; the hound fled to the empty fireplace,
      and barked. The two opponents struggled fiercely
      to shake off the would-be peacemakers, and were for
      killing each other straightway.</p>
    <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[196]</a></span></p>
    <p>"Gentlemen, gentlemen," shouted Ravenshaw
      above the tumult; "not before ladies! not indoors!
      There be the fields behind the tavern, and a good
      moonlight."</p>
    <p>With this, he caught the brunette by the wrists,
      and drew her from the fray. Holding her with his left
      arm, he pushed Master Burney's enemy violently
      toward the door.</p>
    <p>"To the fields, then!" cried the little gentleman.
      "To the fields an he dare follow!"</p>
    <p>Master Burney's reply was drowned by the cries
      of the ladies, as he dashed after the other. The two
      neutral gentlemen, yielding to the trend of the incident,
      accompanied the angry ones forth. The captain,
      instead of following, slammed the door after them,
      released the brunette, and stood with his back to the
      closed door to stop any one else from leaving the
      room. The brunette, shrieking threats, tried again
      and again to pass him, but he pushed her back each
      time until she sank exhausted on a chair by the table;
      and all the while poor Lady Greensleeves wailed as
      if her heart would break.</p>
    <p>"'Tis not for ladies to interfere in these matters,"
      said Ravenshaw, when he could make himself heard.
      "A blow has been struck, and men of honour have
      but one course. Their friends will see all fitly done.
      Despair not, mistress: your gallant has great vantage
      in size and strength."</p>
    <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[197]</a></span></p>
    <p>"Then you think he will win?" cried the brunette.
      "Heaven be praised!"</p>
    <p>"Oh, God! oh, God!" moaned Lady Greensleeves.
      "Then my dear servant is a dead man.
      Woe's me! woe's me! I'll turn nun; nay, I'll take
      poison, that I will!"</p>
    <p>"Why, madam," said Ravenshaw, "your gentleman
      will acquit himself well, be sure of it. He is so
      quick; and the other's bulk is in your man's favour."</p>
    <p>It was now the brown beauty's turn to be dismayed.</p>
    <p>"Oh, thank heaven!" cried Lady Greensleeves,
      smiling gratefully through her tears. "Yes, indeed,
      he is quick; he will give that big Burney a dozen
      thrusts ere the great fellow can move."</p>
    <p>At this the dark woman started up for another
      struggle with Ravenshaw, but he stayed her with
      the words:</p>
    <p>"Nay, the small gentleman is too light to thrust
      hard. Think of Master Burney's weight; when he
      does touch, 'twill go home, no doubt of that."</p>
    <p>All this time the captain was on tenter-hooks lest
      the fight had really begun; a moment's loss of time
      would be fatal to his purpose; he must bring matters
      to a point.</p>
    <p>"In very truth," he said, "as a man acquainted
      with these things, if I were to wager which of the
      two is like to be killed&#8212;"</p>
    <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[198]</a></span></p>
    <p>"Which?" cried the women together, as he paused.</p>
    <p>"Both!"</p>
    <p>Even Greensleeves sprang up this time, and Ravenshaw
      found himself confronted by two desperate,
      sobbing creatures.</p>
    <p>"Back, ladies!" he shouted, quickly. "I will
      stop their fighting!"</p>
    <p>They stood still, regarding him with wondering
      inquiry.</p>
    <p>"If you will stay in this room," he continued.</p>
    <p>"We will not stir a step," cried Lady Greensleeves.
      "Make haste, for God's sake!"</p>
    <p>"And if you will give me a handful of those
      yellow boys yonder," he added.</p>
    <p>With a cry of joy, Greensleeves swept up a handful
      of the two little piles of gold, and held it out
      to him.</p>
    <p>"Stay," said the brown lady, closing her palm
      over the gold in the other's hand. "He shall have
      it&#8212;when he brings the two gentlemen back to us,
      friends and unscathed."</p>
    <p>"That's fair," said Ravenshaw; "so that you give
      it to me privately, ere they take note."</p>
    <p>"Yes, yes!" panted the brunette; and "God's
      name, haste!" cried Greensleeves; and the captain,
      without another word, dashed out of the room, and
      down the stairs.</p>
    <p>He ran through the garden behind the tavern, and<span class="pagenum"><a
          id="Page_199" name="Page_199">[199]</a></span>
      so by a gate, which the gentlemen had left open,
      to the fields, which stretched northward to Clerkenwell
      and Islington. He descried the four gallants
      near at hand, where they had chosen a clean, level
      piece of turf. Fortunately, the many noises in the
      tavern, noises of music, laughter, gaming, and singing,
      had kept attention from being drawn to the
      tumult of this affair, and so no one had followed
      the four gentlemen out. The two who had tried
      to make peace had now fallen naturally into the
      place of seconds, and were finishing the preliminaries
      of the fight, while the adversaries stood with their
      doublets off, waiting for the time to begin. Just
      as their weapons met, with a musical ring of steel,
      the captain dashed in and struck up the rapiers with
      his own.</p>
    <p>"Gentlemen, I am defrauded here," he said, as
      the combatants stood back in surprise. "I was the
      first to offend, in the house yonder, and the first to
      be offended. 'Tis my right to fight one of you first&#8212;I
      care not which&#8212;and, by this hand, you shall
      not proceed till my quarrel is settled!"</p>
    <p>"Oh, pish, man!" said the little gallant; "we
      have no quarrel with you. Our fight is begun; I
      pray, stand aside, and let us have it out."</p>
    <p>"Upon one condition, then," said Ravenshaw.</p>
    <p>The two gallants raised their points, to rush at
      each other.</p>
    <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[200]</a></span></p>
    <p>"That the survivor shall fight me afterward," he
      finished.</p>
    <p>The two gallants lowered their points, and hesitated.</p>
    <p>"Troth, I have taken no offence of you, sir," said
      Master Burney; "and given none, I think."</p>
    <p>"But your ladies yonder gave me offence; and
      to whom shall I look for reparation, if not to you
      two?"</p>
    <p>"Faith," said the small gallant, "a man who undertook
      to give reparation for every foolish word a
      woman spoke, would have no time to eat, drink,
      or sleep."</p>
    <p>"I see how it is," said Ravenshaw, with a shrug.
      "I may not hope for satisfaction unless I force you
      to self-defence; and that would be murder. But,
      by the foot of a soldier, if I must go without reparation,
      I'll not be the only one! If I forego, so must
      you both. How like you that, Master Burney?"</p>
    <p>"How can I? He struck me a blow."</p>
    <p>"Well, no doubt, if I pray him, he will withdraw
      the blow. Will you not, sir?"</p>
    <p>"I do not like to," answered the little man; "but
      if he will withdraw his laughter&#8212;"</p>
    <p>"Why, forsooth, a man of known courage may
      withdraw anything, and no harm to his reputation,"
      said the captain. "To prove it I will withdraw all
      offence I have given, and will take it that you two,<span class="pagenum"><a
          id="Page_201" name="Page_201">[201]</a></span>
      on behalf of the ladies, withdraw all offence they
      have done me. Saviolo himself, I swear, could
      not adjust a quarrel more honourably. What say
      you, shall we go back now in peace and friendship
      to bring joy to the hearts of the ladies who are
      dying of fear? Come, gentlemen, my sword is the
      first to be put up, look you."</p>
    <p>Somewhat sheepishly, the adversaries followed
      his example, to the amusement of the seconds, who
      would doubtless have acted with similar prudence
      had they been exposed to the risk of having to fight
      Captain Ravenshaw. The captain then took Master
      Burney and the little gentleman each by an arm, and
      started for the tavern, followed by the other two.
      The song of the three inns-of-court men returned to
      his mind, and he and the two fighters marched back
      to the ladies, singing at the top of their voices:</p>
    <p>
      "For three merry men, and three merry men,<br />
      <span style="margin-left: 1em;">And three merry men we be."</span><br />
    </p>
    <p>Lady Greensleeves folded the little gentleman in
      her arms till he grimaced with discomfort; the
      brown beauty leaped up and clung around Master
      Burney's neck; but, as she did so, she dangled behind
      his back a purse, in the face of Captain Ravenshaw,
      to whose hand she relinquished it a moment
      later. The captain stepped out into the passage,
      made sure that the purse really contained a handful<span class="pagenum"><a
          id="Page_202" name="Page_202">[202]</a></span>
      of gold, and then fled down the stairs ere any but
      the brunette knew he was gone.</p>
    <p>The fiddlers, who had waited through all the suspense
      of the women, now struck up a merry love
      tune, and Master Burney bawled for a drawer to
      bring some more wine, declaring he must drink the
      health of Captain Ravenshaw; but the captain was
      hastening to his lodging in Smithfield, grinning to
      himself, and fingering the heavy round pieces in the
      purse.</p>

      <blockquote><p><span style="margin-left: 1em;">"If I know what to say to her now</span><br />
      In the way of marriage, I'm no graduate."<br />
      &#8212;<i>A Chaste Maid in Cheapside.</i><br /></p></blockquote>

    <p>As Ravenshaw climbed the narrow stairs to his
      room in darkness, he heard the voice of his fellow
      lodger in loud and continued denunciation. Wondering
      at this, for the scholar was wont to speak
      little and never vehemently, the captain hastened
      his upward steps, thinking to rescue Master Holyday
      from some quarrel with the landlord or other
      person. But when he burst into the chamber he
      found the poet alone, pacing the floor in the flickering
      light of an expiring candle, his hair tumbled, his
      eyes wild, one hand gesticulating, while the other
      held his new-written manuscript.</p>
    <p>At sight of Ravenshaw the poet stopped short a
      moment, then finished the passage he had been
      spouting, dropped the manuscript on the table, and,
      coming back to the present with a kind of tired
      shiver, sank exhaustedly upon a joint stool.</p>
    <p>"Excellent ranting," said the captain, "and most
      suitable to what I have to say." He threw his hat<span class="pagenum"><a
          id="Page_204" name="Page_204">[204]</a></span>
      and sword-girdle on a bed in a corner of the room,
      filled and lighted a pipe of tobacco, and took up his
      stand before the chimney as one who had weighty
      matters to propound.</p>
    <p>"How suitable?" queried Master Holyday, with
      a languor consequent upon his long stretch of poetic
      fervour.</p>
    <p>"As thus," replied the captain, with a puff. "Your
      play there concerns the carrying away of a lady."</p>
    <p>"Of Helen by Paris; yes. But that is only a little
      part&#8212;"</p>
    <p>"'Tis a part that you have conducted properly
      and well, no doubt."</p>
    <p>"Why, without boasting, I profess some slight
      skill in these matters."</p>
    <p>"Well, now, look you. Your carrying away this
      lady in the spirit is well; 'tis a fit preparation for
      your carrying away a lady in the flesh."</p>
    <p>Master Holyday broke off in the middle of a yawn
      and stared.</p>
    <p>"You shall carry away this goldsmith's daughter to-morrow
      night. Now mark how all is to be done&#8212;"</p>
    <p>"God's name, are you mad?" cried the scholar,
      roused from his lassitude into a great astonishment.</p>
    <p>"No more mad than to have planned all this for
      the saving of that maid from dire calamities, and the
      making of your joy and fortune."</p>
    <p>"My joy?"</p>
    <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[205]</a></span></p>
    <p>"Ay, indeed; for to possess that maid&#8212;"</p>
    <p>"Oh, the maid&#8212;hang all maids!" exclaimed
      Holyday, with a kind of shudder, and falling into
      perturbation. "I'll none of 'em!"</p>
    <p>"And as to your fortune, how often have you told
      me what welcome and comfort wait you at your
      father's house the day you come to him with a
      wife?"</p>
    <p>"Wife!" echoed Master Holyday, and first paled
      with horror, and then gave forth a ghastly laugh.</p>
    <p>"Ay," said the captain, "and such a wife, your
      father will bless the day that made her his daughter!
      E'en though she come without dowry, he cannot
      choose but take her to his heart. Her father will
      not hold out for ever, perchance, when he finds her
      married to his old friend's son. But if he does, she
      hath an uncle who is like to make her his heir, I take
      it. And so, man, there's an end to this beggary for
      you. And now mark what is to be done&#8212;"</p>
    <p>"No, no, no! I have not the stomach for it. I
      have not!"</p>
    <p>"We must be stirring early in the morning," went
      on the captain, "for all must be arranged ere I leave
      London at noon. And first, how you are to call
      upon the goldsmith's family, and secretly get the
      girl's consent."</p>
    <p>"Get her consent! Never, never! I'll do no
      wooing; not I!"</p>
    <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[206]</a></span></p>
    <p>"By God, and you will that, and 'tis I that
      say so!"</p>
    <p>The scholar looked wildly at the captain a moment,
      then rose and made for the door, as if to
      escape a fearful doom. Ravenshaw quickly caught
      up the manuscript of the puppet-play, and held it
      ready to tear it across. The poet stopped, with a
      sharp cry of alarm, and came back holding out his
      hand for the freshly covered sheets of paper. But
      the captain pushed him to a seat, and retained the
      manuscript.</p>
    <p>"I'll tear it into fifty pieces, and burn 'em before
      your face," said Ravenshaw, "if you listen not quietly
      to what you must do."</p>
    <p>Poor Holyday, keeping his eyes anxiously upon
      the precious work, gave a piteous groan, and sat
      limp and helpless.</p>
    <p>"At daybreak," began Ravenshaw, "we shall go
      together and bespeak the boat that shall carry
      you and the maid, and your attendants, down the
      river in the evening. It shall be your business
      next to visit the goldsmith as if you came newly
      to London from your father in the country. Tell
      Master Etheridge you intend to marry a lady in
      Kent, and that you will be purchasing jewels and
      plate."</p>
    <p>"But, God's sake!" objected the scholar, dismally,
      and as if he partly doubted the captain's sanity,<span class="pagenum"><a
          id="Page_207" name="Page_207">[207]</a></span>
      "have you not passed yourself off to him as me?
      And how, then, will he believe that I am I?"</p>
    <p>"Troth, I have been discovered to him as my true
      self."</p>
    <p>"Well, then, as he has been once imposed on, he
      will treat me as an impostor, too," urged Holyday,
      desperately ready to find impediments.</p>
    <p>"No, for if he makes any question, you need but
      stand upon your likeness to your mother. And then
      you can mention a thousand things that his memory
      must share with yours, where I could mention but
      the few you told me. And there was a mistake
      I made, saying it was a terrier that bit him in
      the leg the last time he was at your house, whereas
      it was a water-spaniel, as you had told me. If you
      speak of the spaniel biting him, you will prove yourself
      the true Holyday, and confirm it that I was
      a false one."</p>
    <p>"Ne'ertheless," moaned the scholar, in despair at
      the whole matter, "'twill seem a dubious thing, two
      men appearing within three days' time, both calling
      themselves Francis Holyday's son."</p>
    <p>"'Tis easily made clear. Say that, travelling to
      London three days ago, you fell in with that rascal,
      Ravenshaw, but knew not what a knave he was.
      Say that he won upon your confidence, you being free
      of mistrust, so that you told him many things of
      yourself, and your intended marriage, and your pur<span class="pagenum"><a
          id="Page_208" name="Page_208">[208]</a></span>pose
      in coming to London, and of Master Etheridge.
      And say that you both took lodgings for the night at
      an inn in Southwark; when you woke in the morning
      you found yourself ill, and two nights and a day had
      passed while you slept, so that Ravenshaw must have
      given you a draught in your wine, and gone to counterfeit
      you in the goldsmith's house, thinking to
      make some use of his freedom therein. Oh, they
      will swallow that without a sniff! And, look you,
      call me a thousand ill names, and say 'tis your
      dearest wish to kill the scurvy rogue that cozened
      you so."</p>
    <p>Holyday uttered a deep sigh, and shook his head
      lugubriously.</p>
    <p>"And note this," pursued Ravenshaw, "no word
      to any but the maid that she is the lady you came
      to marry. They are hot upon tying her to an old
      withered ass, a knight of Berkshire. That she may
      escape him, I have planned this good fortune for
      you; but all must be done to-morrow, for he is
      already in town for the wedding, and there is another
      danger threatens her, too, if she tarries in London.
      So, when you have been admitted to the family,
      you must find, or contrive, some time alone with
      Mistress Millicent, and speedily open the matter to
      her."</p>
    <p>Holyday visibly trembled, and was the picture of
      woe. "Good God!" he exclaimed; "how I shall<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_209"
          name="Page_209">[209]</a></span>
      find voice to speak to her, and words to say, I know
      not!"</p>
    <p>"One thing will make all easy in a trice. Her
      Uncle Bartlemy, whom you know, would serve her
      an he saw the way; and even to the last she has
      looked for some secret help from him. You shall
      therefore begin by saying you come from her Uncle
      Bartlemy, who bids her accept you as a husband.
      Say that his description of her beauty, and of her
      unhappy plight, hath so wrought upon your mind
      that you were deep in love ere you e'en saw her.
      And then say the reality so far outshines the description,
      your love is a thousand times confirmed and
      multiplied. She cannot but believe you are from her
      uncle, knowing you live in his part of the country.
      After that, if you have time for a few love speeches
      of a poetical nature, such as, no doubt, this work is
      full of" (he held up the manuscript)&#8212;</p>
    <p>"Troth," said the poet, "'twere easier for me to
      write whole folios of love than speak a line of it to
      a real maid!"</p>
    <p>"Oh, heart up, man!" said Ravenshaw. "'Twill
      be smooth sailing, once a start is made. But you
      will not have to say much. Your youth and figure
      will speak for you when she contrasts them with Sir
      Peregrine. In her present mind, any man were a
      sweet refuge from that old kex. I remember she
      said she would prefer a good swordman; tell her you
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_210" name="Page_210">[210]</a></span>
      are a good swordman, therefore. And then bid her
      meet you at her garden gate in Friday Street at
      dusk, ready for a journey. Not earlier, look you, for
      the men who will attend you may not be in waiting
      at the White Horse till sunset, and 'twere dangerous
      to miss them."</p>
    <p>The scholar breathed fast and hard, as if a burden
      were being forced upon him, under which he must
      surely faint, and his eyes roved about as if seeking
      a way of evasion.</p>
    <p>"Now all this must be agreed upon betwixt you
      and the maid a full hour before noon," proceeded
      Ravenshaw, "so that you may come to me with the
      news ere I set out from London. I wish to go to
      my new affairs with an easy mind. The place I go
      to is not far from that to which you and the maid
      shall go, and I will meet you in proper time. But
      take note of one thing. She is not to know that I
      have the least hand in this business; if she did, she
      would not stir a step in it, for she abhors the very
      name of Ravenshaw. Therefore, when you are with
      her, if my name comes up, be sure you vilify me
      roundly."</p>
    <p>"I could vilify you now, for pushing me into this
      business!"</p>
    <p>"Very like; and think not to get out of it till it's
      done; for, mark well, I shall not be far from you
      while you are in the goldsmith's house. I shall
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_211" name="Page_211">[211]</a></span>
      bring you in sight of the house, and shall wait in
      sight of it till you come out; and if you come not
      out by eleven o'clock, and with word that all is
      planned, then, by these two hands, I know not what
      will happen!"</p>
    <p>The poor scholar shrank at the captain's fierce
      manner.</p>
    <p>"And now, for your flight and marriage," resumed
      Ravenshaw, after an impressive pause; and he set
      forth particulars as to their being joined by Cutting
      Tom and his men, their taking boat, their trip down
      the river with the vantage of tide and moonlight,
      their landing at whatever point Holyday, in his
      knowledge of the country, should deem best. "You
      will then find your way as fast as may be," he continued,
      "to the house of your friend Sir Nicholas,
      the parson. Prevail upon him to keep you hid there
      till he can marry you by license, which can be quickly
      had of the bishop's commissary of Rochester. Being
      so much your friend, Sir Nicholas will wink
      at little shortcomings,&#8212;such as the consent of the
      girl's parents being omitted, and that of her friends
      sufficing. The maid can swear she is not precontracted;
      there is truly no consanguinity, and for
      names to a bond, the parson can scrape up another
      besides your own. And so, safely tied, you shall
      bear her to your father's house, and defy the
      world."</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_212" name="Page_212">[212]</a></span></p>
    <p>Master Holyday looked as if he fancied himself
      bound to the seat of a galley for life.</p>
    <p>"The parson must lodge your attendants till the
      next day," added Ravenshaw, "when I will come and
      dismiss them. Stable room will do. Belike I will
      see you when I come; but she must not set eyes on
      me. When all's done, you may tell her what you
      will. Her uncle will stand your friend, I think.
      And so, a rascal's blessing on you both!"</p>
    <p>The poet was silent and miserable. But after a
      time he looked up, and, stretching forth his hand,
      said, in a supplicating way:</p>
    <p>"Give me back my puppet-play, then. 'Tis my
      masterwork, I think."</p>
    <p>"You shall have it back when you are married,"
      replied Ravenshaw, placing it carefully inside his
      doublet.</p>
    <p>Master Holyday groaned, as one who gives himself
      up for lost.</p>

    <h2><a id="CHAPTER_XIII" name="CHAPTER_XIII">CHAPTER XIII.</a></h2>
    <div class="center">A RIOT IN CHEAPSIDE.</div>
   <blockquote><p><span style="margin-left: 1em;">
      "Down with them! Cry clubs for prentices!" <br />
      &#8212;<i>The Shoemaker's Holiday.</i><br /></span></p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>Wan and tremulous, after a night of half-sleep
      varied by ominous dreams, Master Holyday was led
      by the captain, in the early morning, to the wharf
      where was to be found the waterman whom Ravenshaw
      knew he could trust. The scholar attended in
      a kind of dumb trance to the interview between
      Ravenshaw and the boatman, who was a powerful,
      leather-faced fellow, one that listened intently, scrutinised
      keenly, and expressed himself in quick nods
      and short grunts. Even the unwonted sight of gold
      in the captain's hands did not stir the unhappy poet
      to more than a transient look of faint wonder.</p>
    <p>Ravenshaw pulled him by the sleeve to a cook's
      shop in Thames Street, but the wretched graduate
      had difficulty in gulping down his food, and scarce
      could have told whether it was hot pork pie or cold
      pease porridge. It went differently with the ale
      which the captain caused to be set before them afterward.
      Holyday poured this down his throat with
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[214]</a></span>
      feverish avidity, and pushed forth his pot for more.
      At last Ravenshaw, considering it time for the goldsmith's
      family to be up, grasped his companion firmly
      by the crook of the arm, and said, curtly:</p>
    <p>"Come!"</p>
    <p>The poor scholar, limp and sinking, turned gray in
      the face, and went forth with the look of a prisoner
      dragged to execution. The captain had to exert
      force to keep him from lagging behind, as the two
      went northward through Bread Street. They stopped
      once, to buy a cheap sword, scabbard, and hanger;
      which Holyday dreamily suffered the shopman to
      attach to his girdle. Nearing Cheapside, the doomed
      bachelor hung back more and more, and when finally
      they turned into that thoroughfare, his face all terror,
      he suddenly jerked from Ravenshaw's hold, and made
      a bolt toward Cornhill.</p>
    <p>But the captain, giving chase, caught him by the
      collar, in front of Bow church, seized his neck as in
      a vice, turned him about toward the goldsmith's
      house, took a tighter hold of his arm, and impelled
      him relentlessly forward. From his affrighted eyes,
      ashen cheeks, and dragging gait, people in the street
      supposed he was being taken to Newgate prison by a
      queen's officer.</p>
    <p>"Now, look you," said the captain, with grim
      earnestness, as they approached Master Etheridge's
      shop, "I durst not go too near the place. I shall
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[215]</a></span>
      leave you in a moment; but I shall go over the
      way, and take my post behind the cross, where I
      can watch the house in safety. Mark this: my hand
      shall be upon my sword-hilt, and if you try flight, or
      come forth unsuccessful, you shall find yourself as
      dead a poet as Virgil&#8212;what though I swing for you,
      I care not! Come forth not later than the stroke
      of eleven; walk toward the Poultry, and I will join
      you. Keep me not waiting, or, by this hand&#8212;Go;
      and remember!"</p>
    <p>He gave the scholar a parting push, and strode
      across the street; a few seconds later he was peering
      around the corner of the cross, and Master Holyday
      was lurching into the goldsmith's shop.</p>
    <p>The shop, as has been said, extended back to where
      a passage separated it from domestic regions of the
      house; but it was, itself, in two parts,&#8212;a front part,
      open to the street, and a more private part, where the
      master usually stayed, with his most valuable wares.</p>
    <p>In entering the outer shop, Holyday had to pass
      the end of a case, at which a flat-capped, snub-nosed,
      solid-bodied apprentice was arranging gold cups,
      chains, and trinkets.</p>
    <p>"What is't you lack?" demanded this youth,
      squaring up to the scholar.</p>
    <p>"God knows," thought Holyday. "My wits, I
      think." And then he found voice to say that he
      desired speech of Master Etheridge.</p>
    <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[216]</a></span></p>
    <p>The shopman pointed to the open door leading to
      the farther apartment, and thither Holyday went.
      The place was mainly lighted by a side window; the
      poet could not fail to distinguish the master, by his
      rich cloth doublet and air of authority, from the
      journeymen who sat working upon shining pieces of
      plate.</p>
    <p>"What is it you lack, sir?" inquired Master
      Etheridge.</p>
    <p>"Sir," replied Holyday, in a small, trembling
      voice, "I must pray you, bear with me if I speak
      wildly. I am sick from a sleeping-drug that a villain
      abused me with three days ago,&#8212;one Captain
      Ravenshaw&#8212;"</p>
    <p>At this name the goldsmith, who had received
      elaborate accounts from Sir Peregrine of last night's
      incident in the garden, suddenly warmed out of his
      air of coldness and distrust, and began to show a
      sympathetic curiosity which made it easier for Holyday
      to proceed with his tale. When the scholar
      announced who he was, the goldsmith lapsed for a
      moment into a hard incredulity; but this passed
      away as Holyday, not daring to stop now that he had
      so good an impetus, deftly alluded to his father,&#8212;"whom,
      they say, I scarce resemble, being all my
      mother in face," quoth he parenthetically,&#8212;and
      hoped that Master Etheridge had forgiven him his
      water-spaniel's bite the last time the two had met.</p>

    <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[217]</a></span></p>

    <p>"Aha! I knew it was a water-spaniel," said Master
      Etheridge, triumphantly. "The rogue would have
      it a terrier." This hasty speech required that the
      goldsmith should relate how the impostor had played
      upon him and his household; at which news Master
      Holyday had to open his eyes, and feign great
      astonishment and indignation. He found this kind
      of acting easier than he had supposed, and was
      beginning to feel like a live, normal creature; when
      suddenly his mind was brought back to the real task
      before him by Master Etheridge, saying:</p>
    <p>"Well, the rascal failed of his purpose here,
      whatever it was; and now 'twill please the women to
      see the true after the counterfeit. This way, pray&#8212;what,
      art so ill? Tom, Dickon, hold him up!"</p>
    <p>"Nay, I can walk, I thank ye," said poor Holyday,
      faintly, and accompanied his host into the passage,
      and up the stairs to the large room overlooking
      Cheapside. No one being there, the goldsmith went
      elsewhere in search of his wife, leaving the scholar
      to a discomfiting solitude. He gazed out of the
      window at the cross, and fancied he saw the edge of
      a hat-brim that he knew, protruding from the other
      side. He cursed the hour when he had fallen in
      with Ravenshaw, and wished an earthquake might
      swallow the goldsmith's house.</p>
    <p>When he heard Master Etheridge returning, and
      the swish of a feminine gown, he felt that the awful

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[218]</a></span>

      moment had come. But it was only the goldsmith's
      wife, and she proved such a motherly person that he
      found it quite tolerable to sit answering her questions.
      Presently Master Etheridge was called down
      to the shop, and his wife had some sewing brought
      to her, at which she set to work, keeping up with
      Holyday a conversation oft broken by many long
      pauses.</p>
    <p>Each time the door opened, the scholar trembled
      for fear Mistress Millicent would enter. But as time
      passed and she came not, a new fear assailed him,&#8212;that
      he might not be able to see her at all, and that
      the dread stroke of eleven should bring some catastrophe
      not to be imagined. He was now as anxious
      for her arrival on the scene as he had first dreaded
      it. His heart went up to his throat when the door
      opened again; and down to his shoes when it let in
      nobody but Sir Peregrine Medway.</p>
    <p>The old knight inspected Holyday for a moment
      with the curiosity due to genuine ware after one
      has been imposed upon by spurious; and then he
      dropped the youth from attention as a person of no
      consequence, and asked for Mistress Millicent.</p>
    <p>"Troth," said Mistress Etheridge, "the baggage
      must needs be keeping her bed two hours or so;
      said she was not well. She has missed her lesson on
      the virginals. I know not what ails her of late. I'm
      sure 'twas not so with me when I was toward mar<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_219"
          name="Page_219">[219]</a></span>riage,&#8212;but
      she sha'n't mope longer in her chamber.
      Lettice!" she called, going to the door, and gave
      orders to the woman.</p>
    <p>Holyday breathed fast, and stared at the door.
      After a short while Millicent entered, with pouting
      lips, crimson cheeks, and angry eyes; she came
      forward in a reluctant way, and submitted to the
      tremulous embrace of the old knight. Not until
      she was free of his shaking arms did she take note
      of Master Holyday, and then she looked at him with
      the faintest sign of inquiry.</p>
    <p>As for the scholar, a single glance had given him
      a sweeping sense of her beauty; daunted by it, he
      had dropped his eyes, and he dared not raise them
      from the tips of her neatly shod feet, which showed
      themselves beneath the curtain of her pink petticoat.</p>
    <p>"'Tis my daughter, Master Holyday," said Mistress
      Etheridge, "and soon to be Sir Peregrine's
      lady." Holyday bowed vaguely at the pretty shoes,
      and cast a vacuous smile upon the old knight.</p>
    <p>"What, another Master Holyday?" said Millicent,
      in an ironical manner suited to her perverse mood.</p>
    <p>"The true one," replied her mother; "that rogue
      cozened him as he did us. Well, 'twas a lesson,
      Master Holyday, not to prate of your affairs to
      strangers."</p>
    <p>"The rogue shall pay for giving me the lesson,"
      ventured Holyday, bracing himself to play his part.</p>
    <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[220]</a></span></p>
    <p>Mistress Millicent looked as if she doubted this.</p>
    <p>"I know he is a much-vaunted swordman," added
      Holyday, catching her expression; "but I have
      some acquaintance with steel weapons myself."</p>
    <p>His small, unnatural voice was at such variance
      with his words, that Millicent looked amused as well
      as doubting. He felt he was not getting on well,
      and was for sinking into despair; but the thought of
      Ravenshaw waiting behind the cross, hand on hilt,
      acted as a goad, and raised the wretched poet to a
      desperate alertness.</p>
    <p>Master Etheridge came in, holding out his hollowed
      palm. At sight of its contents Mistress Millicent
      turned pale, and caught the back of a chair. Sir
      Peregrine bent his eyes over them gloatingly, and
      took them up in his lean fingers.</p>
    <p>"The wedding-ring, sooth," he said. "Good lack,
      'twas speedy work, father. But which of the two
      is it?"</p>
    <p>"Which you choose," replied the goldsmith.
      "They are like as twins. I had the two made to
      the same measurement; 'tis so small, one of them
      will be a pretty thing to keep in the shop for show.
      Belike there may be another bride's finger in London
      'twill fit."</p>
    <p>"Troth now, my first wife had just such another
      finger," said the knight. "I know not which to
      take; 'tis a pity both cannot be used."</p>
    <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[221]</a></span></p>
    <p>Master Holyday was suddenly inspired with an
      impish thought, the very conception of which brought
      courage with it.</p>
    <p>"An you please, Master Etheridge," he said, "the
      lady I wish to marry hath such another hand, in size,
      as your sweet daughter here can boast of. It were a
      pleasant thing, now, an I might buy one of these
      rings."</p>
    <p>"Nay, by my knighthood," quoth Sir Peregrine,
      with a burst of that magniloquent generosity which
      went with his vanity, "buy it thou shalt not, but
      have it thou shalt. I buy 'em both, father; see 'em
      both put down to me. Here, young sir; and let thy
      bride know what 'tis the mate of." And he tossed
      one of the rings to Holyday, not graciously, but as
      one throws a bone to a dog.</p>
    <p>"She will hold herself much honoured," said Holyday,
      coolly, picking up the little circlet from among
      the rushes, and inwardly glad to make a fool of such a
      supercilious old fop. Noticing that Millicent observed
      his irony and approved it, he went on: "Of a truth,
      though, I am somewhat beforehand in the matter;
      the maid's consent yet hangs fire." And he cast her
      a look which he thought would set her thinking.</p>
    <p>"Troth, then," said the goldsmith, good-humouredly,
      "you go the right way to carry her by storm.
      Show her the wedding-ring, and tell her 'tis for her,
      and I warrant all's done."</p>
    <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[222]</a></span></p>
    <p>"I will take your counsel," said Holyday, glancing
      from the ring to Millicent's finger. "She might be
      afflicted with a worse husband, I tell her."</p>
    <p>"Ay, young man," put in Sir Peregrine, for the
      sake of showing his wisdom in such matters, "be not
      afraid to sound your own praises to her. If you do
      not so yourself, who will?&#8212;except, of course, your
      merits were such as show without being spoken for."
      The knight unconsciously glanced down at himself.</p>
    <p>"Oh, I have those to recommend me that have
      authority with her," said the scholar. "She hath an
      uncle will plead my suit; and truly he ought to, for
      'twas he set me to wooing her, and from his account
      I became her servant ere ever I had seen her."</p>
    <p>"Hath the lady no parents, then?" queried Master
      Etheridge.</p>
    <p>"Oh, yes; they are well inclined to me, too; I
      spoke of the uncle because 'twas his word made me
      first seek her out."</p>
    <p>"And did you find her all he had said?" asked
      Mistress Etheridge.</p>
    <p>"Oh, even more beautiful. 'Tis her beauty makes
      me bashful in commending myself to her."</p>
    <p>"Oh, never be afraid," said Mistress Etheridge.
      "You have a good figure, for one thing, and a
      modest mien."</p>
    <p>"So her mother says," acquiesced Holyday, innocently.</p>
    <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[223]</a></span></p>
    <p>"Your father hath a good estate," said Master
      Etheridge, "and that speaks louder for you than
      modesty or figure."</p>
    <p>"That is what her father hath the goodness to say
      for me. I hope she will take her parents' words to
      mind. But I doubt not, in her heart she thinks me
      better than some."</p>
    <p>"Well, her parents are the best judges," said Master
      Etheridge. "I must go down to the shop; you
      will eat dinner with us, friend Ralph?"</p>
    <p>"I thank you, sir; but I must meet a gentleman
      elsewhere at eleven o'clock."</p>
    <p>If Mistress Millicent had taken his meaning, he
      thought, she would now see the necessity of speedily
      having a word with him alone.</p>
    <p>After the goldsmith had left the room, Sir Peregrine
      directed the conversation into such channels
      that Holyday was perforce out of it. The old
      knight evidently thought that enough talk had
      gone to the affairs of this young gentleman from
      Kent.</p>
    <p>The scholar, wondering how matters would go,
      agitated within but maintaining a kind of preternatural
      calm without, ventured to scan Millicent's face
      for a sign. She was regarding him furtively, as if
      she apprehended, yet feared to find herself deceived;
      in truth, her experience with Captain Ravenshaw
      had made it difficult for her to hope, or trust, anew.<span class="pagenum"><a
          id="Page_224" name="Page_224">[224]</a></span>
      But surely fate could not twice abuse her so; this
      must indeed be Ralph Holyday,&#8212;her father was not
      likely to be deceived a second time,&#8212;and the Holydays
      were neighbours of her uncle, from whom she
      had not entirely ceased to look for aid. In any case,
      there, in the shape of Sir Peregrine, was a horrible
      certainty, to which a new risk was preferable. With
      a swift motion, therefore, she put her finger to her
      lip; and Master Holyday felt a great load lifted from
      his mind.</p>
    <p>While Sir Peregrine was entertaining Mistress
      Etheridge with a minute account of how he had
      once cured himself of a calenture, Millicent suddenly
      asked:</p>
    <p>"What is the posy in your wedding-ring, Master
      Holyday?"</p>
    <p>The scholar screwed up his eyes to see the rhyme
      traced within the circlet.</p>
    <p>"Nay, let me look," she demanded, impatiently.
      "I have better eyes, I trow."</p>
    <p>He handed her the ring; she walked to the window,
      to examine it in good light; the casement was
      open, to let in the soft May air. Suddenly she
      turned to the others, with a cry:</p>
    <p>"Mercy on me! I have dropped Master Holyday's
      ring into the street."</p>
    <p>"Oh, thou madcap child!" exclaimed Mistress
      Etheridge.</p>
    <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[225]</a></span></p>
    <p>"Oh, 'tis nothing," said Holyday, confusedly, not
      yet seeing his way. "I can soon find it."</p>
    <p>"Nay, I saw where it fell," said Millicent, quickly.
      "'Tis right I fetch it back."</p>
    <p>Ere any one could say nay, she ran from the
      room. Holyday, understanding, called out, "Nay,
      trouble not yourself!" and hastened after her as if to
      forestall her in recovering the ring. He was upon the
      stairs in time to see that she went out, not through
      the shop, but through the door from the passage into
      Friday Street. He followed, wondering what Ravenshaw
      would think on seeing the two. When they
      came into Cheapside she began to search a little at
      one side of the open shop-front, so as not to be seen
      from within. Glancing up, however, Holyday saw
      that Mistress Etheridge and Sir Peregrine were looking
      down from the window above. He dared not
      turn his eyes toward the cross, for fear of meeting
      those of Ravenshaw. Both he and the maid searched
      the cobble paving, within whispering space of each
      other.</p>
    <p>"'Tis safe in my hand," she said; "so we may be
      as long finding it as need be. What mean you with
      this talk of a maid's uncle?"</p>
    <p>"I mean thine Uncle Bartlemy," said he, heartened
      up at the easy turn his task had taken. "He sent
      me to save you from wedding this old knight. The
      only escape is by wedding me instead. If you<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_226"
          name="Page_226">[226]</a></span>
      are willing, be at your garden gate in Friday Street
      this nightfall, ready for a journey by boat. The rest
      is in my hands."</p>
    <p>Thank Heaven, she reflected, it needed but a
      word from her to settle the matter. She could
      have swooned for joy at the unexpected prospect
      of escape. But she was not flattered by this young
      stranger's unloverlike manner. The word could wait
      a moment.</p>
    <p>"What, does my uncle think I will take the first
      husband he sends, and go straight to marriage without
      even a wooing beforehand?"</p>
    <p>"Why," said Holyday, thrown back into his agitation,
      "there's no time for wooing before this
      marriage. It must wait till after."</p>
    <p>"Troth, how do I know 'twill be to my liking,
      then, without ever a sample of it first?"</p>
    <p>"Did I not say within," he faltered, feeling very
      red and foolish, "that your charms overpower my
      tongue?"</p>
    <p>"Well, if you think a maid is to be won for
      the mere asking, even though to save herself at
      a pinch, I marvel at you."</p>
    <p>Her tone was decidedly chill. He felt she was
      slipping from him, and he thought of the relentless
      man behind the cross; he must rouse himself to
      a decisive effort.</p>
    <p>"Stay," he said, as the perspiration came out<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_227"
          name="Page_227">[227]</a></span>
      upon his face. "If you must have wooing&#8212;god
      'a' mercy!&#8212;Thy charms envelop me as some sweet
      cloud Of heavenly odours, making me to swoon."</p>
    <p>She threw him a side-glance of amazement, from
      her pretended search of the ground.</p>
    <p>"Wooing!" he thought; "she shall have it,
      of the strongest." And he went on: "And wert
      thou drowned in the floorless sea, Thine eyes would
      draw me to the farthest depths."</p>
    <p>"Why," quoth she, "that sounds like what the
      players speak. Do you woo in blank verse?"</p>
    <p>"'Tis mine own, I swear," he said, truly enough,
      for it was from his new puppet-play of Paris and
      Helen. "I'll give you as many lines as you desire,&#8212;only
      remember that time presses. I must away
      before eleven o'clock. Best agree to be waiting
      at the gate at nightfall, ready for flight."</p>
    <p>"If I wed you, shall I be your slave, or my
      own mistress?"</p>
    <p>"Oh, no&#8212;yes, I mean&#8212;as you will. You
      shall have all your own way," he said, glibly.</p>
    <p>"No stint of gowns, free choice of what I shall
      wear, visits to London at my pleasure, my own
      time to go to the shops, milliners of my own
      choosing?"</p>
    <p>"Yes, yes!"</p>
    <p>"My own horses to ride, and a coach, and what
      maids I like, and what company I desire, and no<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_228"
          name="Page_228">[228]</a></span>
      company I don't desire, and all the days to be spent
      after my liking?"</p>
    <p>"Yes, anything, everything!"</p>
    <p>"Why, then, this marriage will not be such a bad
      thing. But I cannot think you love me, if you give
      me so many privileges."</p>
    <p>"Oh," said he, petulantly, worn almost out of
      patience, "'tis the vehemence of my love makes
      me promise all rather than lose you!" At the same
      time, he said in his heart: "I shall be happier,
      the more such a plague keeps away from me!"</p>
    <p>"How you knock your sword against things!"
      she complained. "One would say you were not used
      to it."</p>
    <p>"'Tis my confusion in your presence," he
      answered, wearily. "I can use the sword well
      enough."</p>
    <p>"Well,&#8212;" She paused a moment, trembling on
      the brink; then said, a little unsteadily: "I will
      be at the gate at nightfall."</p>
    <p>A coach was lumbering along at the farther half
      of the street. A large lady therein, masked, blonde-haired,
      called out toward the other side of the
      cross:</p>
    <p>"How now, Captain Ravenshaw? Hast spent
      all that money? Art waiting for a purse to cut?"</p>
    <p>Millicent gave Holyday a startled look, and exclaimed:</p>
    <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[229]</a></span></p>
    <p>"She said Captain Ravenshaw!&#8212;the rogue that
      cozened you. He must be yonder."</p>
    <p>"Impossible!" gasped the scholar, turning pale.</p>
    <p>"It must be he. She is laughing at him. What,
      are you afraid?&#8212;you that would make him pay for
      the lesson!"</p>
    <p>In desperation, the fate-hounded poet grasped his
      sword-hilt, and strode to the other side of the cross,
      coming face to face with the captain.</p>
    <p>"I'm not to blame," said the terrified scholar, in
      an undertone. "She heard your name; I had to
      seek you&#8212;"</p>
    <p>"Then feign to fight me," answered Ravenshaw,
      whipping out his rapier. "All's lost else."</p>
    <p>Holyday drew his sword, and began to make
      awkward thrusts.</p>
    <p>"Has she consented?" whispered Ravenshaw,
      parrying and returning the lunges in such manner
      as not to touch the other's flesh.</p>
    <p>"Yes," said the poet, continuing to fence, but
      backing from his formidable-looking antagonist in
      spite of himself, so that the two quickly worked
      away from the cross into full view of the goldsmith's
      house.</p>
    <p>Meanwhile, Lady Greensleeves's coach had passed
      on; Mistress Etheridge and Sir Peregrine, from their
      window, had observed Holyday's movement, and now
      recognised the captain; Millicent had run to the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_230"
          name="Page_230">[230]</a></span>
      shop entrance, and her father, seeing her there, had
      come forth wondering what she was doing in the
      street, a question which yielded to his sudden
      interest in the fight. Shopkeepers hastened thither
      from their doors, people in the street quickly gathered
      around, but all kept safely distant from the
      clashing weapons.</p>
    <p>"Give way, and take refuge in the shop," said
      Ravenshaw to his adversary, in the low voice necessary
      between the two, "else somebody will come
      that knows us; if our friendship be spoken of,
      they'll smell collusion."</p>
    <p>The scholar, making all the sword-play of which
      he was capable, rapidly yielded ground.</p>
    <p>"But not too fast," counselled the captain, using
      his skill to make his antagonist show the better,
      "else she'll think you a sorry swordman."</p>
    <p>Poor Holyday, panting, perspiring, weak-kneed,
      light-headed, but upheld by the mysterious force of
      Ravenshaw's steady gaze, did as he was bid. A
      murmur of excited comment arose from the crowd;
      the windows of the high-peaked houses began to
      be filled with faces. Ravenshaw perceived there
      must soon be an end of this; so, nodding for the
      scholar to fall back more rapidly, he advanced with
      thrusts that looked dangerous.</p>
    <p>Millicent, who had stood in bewilderment since the
      beginning of the fight, suddenly realised the folly<span class="pagenum"><a
          id="Page_231" name="Page_231">[231]</a></span>
      of any ordinary man's crossing swords with Captain
      Ravenshaw. If Holyday were slain or hurt, what
      of her escape?</p>
    <p>"Good heaven!" she cried, in a transport of
      alarm. "Master Holyday will be killed! Father,
      help him!"</p>
    <p>"Murder, murder!" shouted the goldsmith.
      "Constables! go for constables, some of ye!"</p>
    <p>Even at that word, the captain's rapier point came
      through a loose part of Master Holyday's doublet,
      and the scholar, for an instant thinking himself
      touched, stumbled back in terror.</p>
    <p>Millicent screamed. "Constables?" cried she;
      "a man might be killed ten times ere they came.
      Prentices! Clubs! clubs!"</p>
    <p>With an answering shout, her father's flat-capped
      lads rushed out from where they had been looking
      across the cases. With their bludgeon-like weapons
      in hand, they took up the cry, "Clubs! clubs!" and
      made for the fighters, intent upon getting within
      striking distance of Ravenshaw.</p>
    <p>The captain turned to keep them off. Holyday,
      quite winded, staggered back to the shop entrance.
      Millicent caught him by the sleeve, and drew him
      into the rear apartment, scarce observed in the fresh
      interest that matters had taken in the street. He
      put away his sword, panting and trembling. She
      led him into the passage, and then to the Friday<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_232"
          name="Page_232">[232]</a></span>
      Street door, bidding him make good his flight, and
      saying she would be at the gate at nightfall. She
      then returned to the front of the shop.</p>
    <p>As he ran down Friday Street, Holyday heard an
      increased tumult in Cheapside behind him; he knew
      that apprentices must be gathering from every side;
      Ravenshaw's position would be that of a stag surrounded
      by a multitude of threatening hounds. A
      thrown club might bring him down at any moment.
      The scholar, with a sudden catching at the throat,
      ran into the White Horse tavern, and, seizing a
      tapster by the arms, said hoarsely in his ear:</p>
    <p>"The noise in Cheapside&#8212;the prentices&#8212;they
      will kill Ravenshaw&#8212;for God's sake, Tony!&#8212;the
      friend of all tapsters, he&#8212;but say not I summoned
      ye."</p>
    <p>He dashed out and away, while Tony was tearing
      off his apron and bawling out the name of every
      drawer in the place.</p>
    <p>Meanwhile, in the middle of Cheapside, in the
      space left open by the swelling crowd for its own
      safety, a strange spectacle was presented: one man
      with sword and dagger, menaced by an ever increasing
      mob of apprentices with their clubs. It was a
      bear baited by dogs, the shouts of the apprentices
      dinning the ears of the onlookers like the barking of
      mastiffs in the ring on the Bankside. When the first
      band of apprentices rushed forth, two stopped short<span class="pagenum"><a
          id="Page_233" name="Page_233">[233]</a></span>
      as his sword-point darted to meet them, and the
      others ran around to attack him from behind. But
      with a swift turn he was threatening these, and they
      sprang away to save themselves. Ere they could
      recover, he was around again to face the renewed
      oncoming of the first two. But now through the
      surging crowd, forcing their way with shouts and
      prods, came apprentices from the neighbouring
      shops, in quick obedience to the cry of "Clubs."
      Ravenshaw was hemmed in on all quarters. By a
      swift rush in one direction, a swift turn in another,
      a swift side thrust of his rapier in a third, a swift
      slash of his dagger in a fourth, he contrived to make
      every side of him so dangerous that each menacing
      foe would fall back ere coming into good striking
      distance.</p>
    <p>He had once thought of backing against the cross,
      so that his enemies might not completely encircle
      him; but he perceived in time that they could then
      fling their clubs at him without risk of hitting any
      one else. As it was, the first club hurled at his
      head, being safely dodged, struck one of the thrower's
      own comrades beyond; a second one, too high thrown,
      landed among some women in the crowd, who set up
      an angry screaming; and a third had the fate of the
      first. Some clubs were then aimed lower, but as
      many missed the captain as met him, and those that
      met him were seemingly of no more effect than if<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_234"
          name="Page_234">[234]</a></span>
      they had been sausages. As those who threw their
      clubs had them to seek, and knew their short knives
      to be useless except at closer quarters than they
      dared come to, the apprentices abandoned throwing,
      and tried for a chance of striking him from behind.</p>
    <p>But he seemed to be all front, so unexpected were
      his turns, so sudden his rushes. Had any of his foes
      continued engaging his attention till a simultaneous
      onslaught could be made from all sides, he had been
      done for; but this would have meant death to those
      that faced him, and not a rascal of the yelling pack
      was equal to the sacrifice. So they menaced him all
      around, approaching, retreating, running hither and
      thither for a better point of attack. But the man
      seemed to have four faces, eight hands; steel seemed
      to radiate from him. They attempted to strike down
      his sword-point, but were never quick enough. With
      set teeth, fast breath, glowing eyes, he thrust,
      and turned, and darted, maintaining around him a
      magic circle, into which it was death to set foot.
      Well he knew that he could not keep this up for
      long; the very pressure of the growing crowd of his
      foes must presently sweep the circle in upon him,
      and though he might kill three or four, or a dozen,
      in the end he must fall beneath a rain of blows.</p>
    <p>And what then? Well, a fighting man must die
      some day, and the madness of combat makes death
      a trifle. But who would be at London Bridge before<span class="pagenum"><a
          id="Page_235" name="Page_235">[235]</a></span>
      noon to pay Cutting Tom, and what would become
      of all his well-wrought designs to save the maid, her
      whose contumely against him it would be sweet to
      repay by securing her happiness? To do some
      good for somebody, as a slight balance against
      his rascally, worthless life&#8212;this had been a new
      dream of his. He cast a look toward the goldsmith's
      house. She was now at the window, with
      her mother and Sir Peregrine, and she gazed down
      with a kind of self-accusing horror, as if frightened
      at the storm she had raised. God, could
      he but carry out his purpose yet! His eyes clouded
      for an instant; then he took a deep breath, and
      coolly surveyed his foes.</p>
    <p>More apprentices struggled through the crowd.
      Their cries, thrown back by the projecting gables of
      the houses, were hoarse and implacable. Pushed
      from behind, a wave of the human sea of Ravenshaw's
      enemies was flung close to him. He thrust
      out, and ran his point through a shoulder; instantly
      withdrawing his blade, he sprang toward another
      advancing group, and opened a great red gash in the
      foremost face. A fierce howl of rage went up, and
      even from the spectators came the fierce cry, "Down
      with Ravenshaw! death to the rascal!" Maddened,
      he plunged his weapons into the heaving bundles of
      flesh that closed in upon him, while at last the storm
      of clubs beat upon his head and body. The roar<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_236"
          name="Page_236">[236]</a></span>
      against him ceased not; it was all "Death to him!"
      Not a voice was for him, not a look showed pity,
      not a&#8212;</p>
    <p>"Ravenshaw! Ravenshaw! Tapsters for Ravenshaw!"</p>
    <p>What cry was this, from the narrow mouth of
      Friday Street, a cry fresh and shrill, and audible
      above the hoarse roar of the crowd? Everybody
      turned to look. Some among the apprentices, tavern-lads
      themselves, stood surprised, and then, seeing
      Tony and his fellow drawers from the White Horse
      beating a way through the crowd with clubs and
      pewter pots, promptly took up the cry, "Tapsters
      for Ravenshaw!" and fell to belabouring the shop
      apprentices around them. The new shout was
      echoed from the corner of Bread Street, as a troop
      of pot-boys from the Mermaid, apprised by a backyard
      messenger from the White Horse, came upon
      the scene. The prospect of a more general fight,
      against weapons similar to their own, acted like
      magic upon Ravenshaw's assailants. Those who
      were not disabled turned as one man, to crack heads
      more numerous and easier to get at. Ravenshaw,
      with an exultant bound of the heart, made a final
      rush, upsetting all before him, for the goldsmith's
      shop; ran through to the passage, turned and gained
      the door leading to the garden, dashed forward and
      across the turf, unfastened the gate, and plunged<span class="pagenum"><a
          id="Page_237" name="Page_237">[237]</a></span>
      down Friday Street with all the breath left in
      him.</p>
    <p>A few of the apprentices pursued him into the
      shop, knocking over a case of jewelry and small
      plate as they crowded forward. The goldsmith,
      appalled at the danger of loss and damage, flung
      himself upon them to drive them back. Those who
      got to the passage ran straight on through to the
      kitchen, instead of deviating to the garden door.
      After a search, they observed the latter.</p>
    <p>But by that time Captain Ravenshaw, registering
      an inward vow in favour of Tony and all tapsters,
      and knowing that the fight must soon die out harmlessly
      in the more ordinary phase it had taken, was
      dragging his aching body down Watling Street to
      meet Cutting Tom at London Bridge.</p>
    <p>"A fit farewell to London," said he to himself.
      "The town will deem itself well rid of a rascal, I
      trow."</p>

    <p>Master Jerningham, upon setting Gregory to dog
      the steps of Ravenshaw, had made all haste from the
      Temple Church to Deptford, where he passed the
      afternoon in busy superintendence, and where he lay
      that night. But whether at work, or in the vain
      attitude of sleep, he housed a furnace within him,
      the signs of which about his haggard eyes were
      terrible to see, to the experienced observation of
      Sir Clement Ermsby when that gentleman greeted
      him upon the deck of the anchored ship in the
      morning.</p>
    <p>"Death of my life, man! thou hast the look of
      Bedlam in thy face. And thou wert formerly the
      man of rock! The wench is not to be thine,
      then?"</p>
    <p>"She is, or I am to be the devil's!" replied
      Jerningham.</p>
    <p>"But we sail to-morrow. Or do we not?"</p>
    <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[239]</a></span></p>
    <p>"Ay, we sail to-morrow. Is not the bishop to
      come and bid us Godspeed, and see us lift anchor?
      But the maid shall sail with us."</p>
    <p>"Oho! Without her consent?"</p>
    <p>"I cannot wait for that longer. I have been some
      time coming to this mind; in bed last night I resolved
      upon my course. Unless my man Gregory hath, by
      some marvel, put the matter forward in the meantime,
      I will take a band of those Wapping rascals"
      (he nodded toward some of his sailors who were
      drawing up casks alongside, singing at the work)
      "to the goldsmith's house to-night, force an upper
      window, and carry her off, though murder be done
      to accomplish it. We sail to-morrow; the deed will
      not be traced till we are far afloat, if ever."</p>
    <p>"'Twill be luck if you get her safe from the house.
      Will you bring her straight to the ship, for the bishop
      to find when he comes to bless our venture?"</p>
    <p>"I am not yet a parish fool. I will take her by
      boat to Blackwall; the Dutchman there will lock her
      up in his inn over night. To-morrow, when the
      bishop has seen us sail, we shall but round the Isle
      of Dogs, and then lay to at Blackwall and fetch
      the maid. A sleeping draught will make easy
      handling of her, and we can bring her aboard in a
      sack. Then ho for the seas, and the island; we
      shall set up our own kingdom there, I trow."</p>
    <p>"If we might give the bishop the slip, and not<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_240"
          name="Page_240">[240]</a></span>
      tarry for his prayers, you'd be spared trusting the
      Dutchman."</p>
    <p>"Oh, he thrives by keeping secrets; he is a safe,
      honest rogue. I durst not give the bishop the slip;
      he would be so fain to know the reason, he would
      send post to the warden of the Cinque Ports; and we
      should have a pinnace alongside as we came into the
      narrow seas. Especially as he would have heard
      of this maid's kidnapping. Such news flies."</p>
    <p>"You were not always wont to be so wary; you
      think of every possibility."</p>
    <p>"I have been warned, in my fortune, of an obstacle
      at the last hour. I must be watchful."</p>
    <p>"Well, God reward your vigilance, and your enterprise
      with the wench," said Sir Clement, lightly. He
      would face anything, and yet cared little for anything,
      save when a whim possessed him.</p>
    <p>Jerningham returned to Winchester House by
      horse, in good time before noon, to see Ravenshaw
      set out for the Grange, and to receive Gregory's
      report of the captain's doings.</p>
    <p>Dismissing the servant who opened the gate at
      which he arrived, Jerningham tied his horse just
      within the entrance, and waited. He would be
      much disappointed if the captain came not, for he
      could not help thinking that the success of his project
      would be the less uncertain, the farther from
      London that man should be. If news of the maid's<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_241"
          name="Page_241">[241]</a></span>
      disappearance reached Ravenshaw's ears ere the ship
      was away beyond recall, things might go ill, for
      Ravenshaw knew whom to suspect. But to the
      lonely Grange, half-way between main road and river,
      reached by a solitary lane that led nowhere else,
      visited by no one, news never found its way. Once
      lodged there, Ravenshaw would stay till he gave up
      hope of receiving the further instructions which Jerningham
      had said he would send; and by that time
      Jerningham and the maid would be far beyond the
      swaggering captain's sword and his roar. The only
      fear was that Ravenshaw might have caught Gregory
      dogging him, and have thrown over the stewardship.</p>
    <p>But at length a quick step was heard, there was
      a tapping at the gate, Jerningham drew it open, and
      the captain stood before him.</p>
    <p>"Well, you have kept your word. Here is the
      horse."</p>
    <p>"A trim beast," quoth Ravenshaw, looking at the
      animal with approval, and not failing to note the good
      quality of the saddle.</p>
    <p>"He will scarce have a trim rider," said Jerningham,
      staring at Ravenshaw's face and clothing. "You
      look as if one horse had already thrown you. What's
      the matter?"</p>
    <p>"Oh, there has been a riot, which I must needs
      leave, that I might not be late with you," said Ravenshaw,
      carelessly.</p>
    <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[242]</a></span></p>
    <p>The two gazed at each other a moment in silence,
      as they had done at a former interview. Jerningham
      looked for any sign of Ravenshaw's having detected
      Gregory's espionage, and found none. Ravenshaw
      waited for Jerningham to mention Gregory's encounter
      with him in the goldsmith's garden, assuming
      that Gregory must have reported it the previous night.
      It was not for Ravenshaw to introduce the subject;
      so it was not introduced at all, and the captain
      mounted the horse.</p>
    <p>"You remember all I told you yesterday, no
      doubt?" said Jerningham. "Touching the place
      you are going to, I mean."</p>
    <p>"Yes; I shall find it easily enough. Ay, four
      o'clock, I know. And particular instructions will
      come in a few days. I can wait for instructions
      while provisions last. But one thing&#8212;a steward's
      chain&#8212;good gold, look you!"</p>
    <p>"It shall be of the best," replied Jerningham, with
      his strange smile. "When it comes," he said to
      himself, as the captain rode out of the gate.</p>
    <p>And the captain was saying to <i>himself</i>: "Either
      his knave has not told him, or he counts it of no
      matter. Ten to one, from his look, he is forging
      some plot against her; but she will be safe from all
      plots this time to-morrow, I think." And he headed
      his horse for the Canterbury road.</p>
    <p>Jerningham went to his own chamber in Win<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_243"
          name="Page_243">[243]</a></span>chester
      House, a fair room looking toward the church
      of St. Mary Overie. He had not been there a quarter
      of an hour, when to him came Gregory, dusty and
      tired, but eager-eyed.</p>
    <p>"What news?" inquired the master, with simulated
      coldness.</p>
    <p>"An't please you, sir, I have stuck to his heels
      since you bade me. Twice they led me to that goldsmith's
      house."</p>
    <p>"Ah! What happened there? Make short telling
      of it, knave!"</p>
    <p>"The first time was last night. The maid talked
      with him alone in the garden. I could not hear what
      they said, until she called him by the name of Holyday."</p>
    <p>"A false name. The rascal!&#8212;then he has his
      plot, too!"</p>
    <p>"Ay, sir; and, thinking to nip it in the bud, I
      came forth and denounced him to her, saying he was
      Ravenshaw. Belike he spoke of it to you awhile
      ago."</p>
    <p>"Go on. What did the maid then?"</p>
    <p>"She spurned him as he were kennel mud, and he
      came away like a whipped hound. But I had already
      given him the slip, to save my skin."</p>
    <p>"Troth, then, all betwixt her and him must have
      come to naught."</p>
    <p>"So one would think. And yet&#8212;But you must<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_244"
          name="Page_244">[244]</a></span>
      know that I still dogged him, to carry out your full
      command. He kept me waiting outside many taverns,
      but at last went into a house in Smithfield
      which I took to be his lodging for the night. Bethinking
      me of the danger if he chanced to see me
      by daylight, I went to a friend of mine in that
      neighbourhood&#8212;a horse-stealer, if truth must be
      told&#8212;and borrowed a false beard and a countryman's
      russet coat. In these I followed the man when
      he set forth at daybreak with his companion, that
      lean young gentleman you saw with him in Paul's."</p>
    <p>"Oh, fewer words. What hath the lean young
      gentleman to do&#8212;?"</p>
    <p>"Much, I trow, an it please you. The end of
      their going about was, that the lean companion,
      under some pressure from the captain, went to the
      goldsmith's house, while the captain waited behind
      the cross in Cheapside, e'en as I waited at the
      corner of Milk Street."</p>
    <p>Gregory then described the occurrences in front
      of the goldsmith's shop. What to think of the
      fight between Ravenshaw and the scholar, he knew
      not, whether it marked a falling out between them
      or was part of a plot. Jerningham was of opinion
      it was part of a plot. The serving-man told of Ravenshaw's
      flight into the shop from the apprentices.</p>
    <p>"They that ran after him," he continued, "came
      out presently, saying he must have fled by the back<span class="pagenum"><a
          id="Page_245" name="Page_245">[245]</a></span>
      way. I pushed through to Friday Street, and saw
      the gate indeed open. Methought he would now
      fain come to you, for shelter and protection; and
      so I started hither. And lo! at t'other end of
      London Bridge, whom did I set eyes on but my
      captain, counting over money to another fellow of
      his own kind, but more scurvy. I kept out of sight
      till they parted, and then, while the captain crossed
      the bridge, I accosted the scurvy fellow and said
      there was one would deal with him as fairly as the
      captain had, if he chose."</p>
    <p>"Well, well, and what said he?"</p>
    <p>"He was for killing me, at first, but the end of
      it was that he is now waiting for a word with you
      yonder at the bridge. We have seen the captain
      ride away, and all is safe. I took off my beard and
      russet gown in the lane without, and hid them in
      the stable." And the faithful rascal, with bowed
      head, watched narrowly for the look of approval
      to which he felt entitled.</p>
    <p>"You have done well, Gregory; and you shall
      eat, drink, and sleep, to pay for your abstinence,&#8212;but
      first come to the bridge and show me this man.
      And remember, if my Lord Bishop's servants are
      inquisitive, you lay at Deptford last night, as I did."
      A few minutes later Master Jerningham was in
      converse with Cutting Tom at the Southwark end
      of London Bridge, beneath the gate tower, on top<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_246"
          name="Page_246">[246]</a></span>
      of which was a forest of poles crowned with the
      weatherbeaten heads of traitors.</p>
    <p>"Oh, but sell secrets, that is too much!" Cutting
      Tom was saying, in an injured tone. "A poor soldier
      hath little but his honour. Belike I am ill-favoured
      with wounds, and ragged with poverty
      through serving my country, but my honour, sir!
      my trust! my loyalty! Troth, 'tis mine only jewel,
      and if I sold it&#8212;well, I should want a good price,
      and there's the hell of it!"</p>
    <p>But even when a price was fixed, Cutting Tom,
      dazzled on one side by his lifetime's chance of
      obtaining so excellent a patron, on the other side
      fearful of Ravenshaw's vengeance, temporised and
      mumbled and held back, until Jerningham assured
      him of protection and of Ravenshaw's long absence
      from London. The rascal then told all he knew
      of what was planned to be carried out that night.</p>
    <p>Jerningham listened with apparent passivity,
      though at the last he averted his eyes lest his exultation
      should gleam out of them. Here was all
      trouble, all desperate and well-nigh impossible venturing,
      made needless on his part. He studied the
      matter for a minute, and then said, musingly:</p>
    <p>"His companion and a maid&#8212;the White Horse&#8212;'tis
      the nearest tavern&#8212;sooth, there can be no
      question it is she. Look you, sirrah, I must know
      to what place they are bound."</p>
    <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[247]</a></span></p>
    <p>"I would I knew. 'Tis somewhere on the Kentish
      side of the river."</p>
    <p>"What, would the rascal dare?&#8212;think you 'tis
      the place he is now riding to?"</p>
    <p>"He said he would be in the neighbourhood of
      our destination, and he would come to-morrow to pay
      and dismiss us."</p>
    <p>"If he is to come to you to-morrow, it cannot be
      to the Grange,&#8212;he will be there already. He
      knows more of that neighbourhood than he would
      have me think; he used the name Holyday&#8212;there's
      a Holyday family in that country. Well, I know
      not; but 'tis certain you will be near my house of
      Marshleigh Grange."</p>
    <p>A grim smile flitted over Jerningham's face, as he
      saw another difficulty removed&#8212;for he could now
      dispense with the use of the Dutch innkeeper at
      Blackwall, and with the risk of putting his captive
      aboard from so public a place.</p>
    <p>"Now mark," said he, while he held Cutting Tom
      with fixed eyes, "you will indeed have four men
      with you when you meet the gentleman and maid at
      the White Horse; but one of those four shall be
      a man I will send there betimes. You will easily
      know him; he is the man that brought you to see
      me. His beard, you must know, is false, and you
      will warn your men; else, detecting it, they might
      snatch it off in mirth. Without disguise, he would<span class="pagenum"><a
          id="Page_248" name="Page_248">[248]</a></span>
      be known to the maid and gentleman,&#8212;then our
      business were undone. And so, to the journey."</p>
    <p>Proceeding, he gave orders full and concise, to
      which Cutting Tom lent the best attention of his
      cunning mind. Then, being curtly dismissed, the
      rascal, between elation at his great windfall, and perturbation
      at the temerity of betraying Captain Ravenshaw,
      shambled off through the darkish lane that the
      rows of high shop-houses made of London Bridge.</p>
    <p>Master Jerningham, returning to Winchester
      House, was rejoined by Gregory at the place where
      the serving-man had waited.</p>
    <p>"You have five hours wherein to fill your stomach
      and sleep; and then you must be off upon a night's
      work that shall make you your own man, if it turn
      out well."</p>
    <p>The zealous hound, a little staggered at the opening
      words of this announcement, took fresh life at its
      conclusion, and looked with new-lighted eyes for
      commands.</p>
    <p>Having given these with the utmost particularity,
      Jerningham presented himself, in all docility and
      humbleness, to the bishop in the latter's study,
      where he made a careful tale of his readiness for
      sailing on the morrow.</p>
    <p>He then took horse for Deptford; upon arriving,
      he related his good fortune, and set forth his new plan
      to Sir Clement Ermsby, on the deck of the ship.</p>
    <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[249]</a></span></p>
    <p>"But how at the Grange, man, if Ravenshaw be
      there?" Sir Clement asked.</p>
    <p>"I shall go there betimes, and send him straight
      upon some errand&#8212;some three days' journey that
      will not wait for daylight."</p>
    <p>"He will think it curiously sudden. Besides, if
      he thinks to meet and pay his men in that neighbourhood
      to-morrow, he will not be for any three
      days' journey to-night."</p>
    <p>"Most men will defer paying money, when their
      interests require. I can but try sending him."</p>
    <p>"And if he refuse to stir? What will you then?"</p>
    <p>"Kill him! There will be enough of us, in good
      sooth."</p>
    <p>"Ay, no doubt," acquiesced Sir Clement, carelessly.
      "Methinks the weather bodes a change," he
      added, looking at the sky. "It may rain to-night."</p>
    <p>"Rain or shine, storm or fair," replied Master
      Jerningham, his eyes aglow, "I feel it within me,
      this is the night shall give me my desire."</p>

      "Thou liest. I ha' nothing but my skin,<br />
      And my clothes; my sword here, and myself."<br />
      &#8212;<i>The Sea Voyage.</i><br /></p>
    </blockquote>

    <p>Captain Ravenshaw headed his horse for the
      Canterbury road, and, having soon left the town
      behind him, began to feel a pleasant content in the
      sunlight and soft air. The fresh green of spring,
      the flowers of May, the glad twitter of birds, met his
      senses on every side. Never since his boyhood had
      the sight and smell of hawthorn been more sweet.
      He conceived he had, for once, earned the right to
      enjoy so fair a day. He was tired and bruised, but
      he looked forward to rest upon his arrival. Peace,
      comparative solitude, country ease, seemed so inviting
      that he had not a regret for the town he left
      behind.</p>
      <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[251]</a></span><br /></p>

      <div class="figcenter">
         <img src="images/i_251fp.jpg" width="367" height="564" alt="" />
         <p class="center">"SUDDENLY THE NARROW WAY BEFORE HIM BECAME<br />
         BLOCKED WITH HUMAN CREATURES."</p>
      </div>

    <p>His road, at the first, was that which Chaucer's
      pilgrims had traversed blithely toward Canterbury.
      He had a few villages to ride through, clustered
      about gray churches, and drowsy in the spring sunshine;
      a few towered and turreted castles, a few
      gabled farmhouses, to pass in sight of. But for the
      most part his way
      was by greenwood and field and
      common, up and down the gentle inclines, and across
      the pleasant levels, of the wavy Kentish country.
      Often it was a narrow aisle through forest, with
      great trunks for pillars, and leafy boughs for pointed
      arches, and here and there a yellow splash where
      the green leaves left an opening for sunlight. And
      then it trailed over open heath dotted with solitary
      trees or little clumps, and along fields enclosed by
      green hedgerows. It was a good road for that time,
      wide enough for two riders to pass each other without
      giving cause for quarrel; ditchlike, uneven,
      rutted, here so stony that a horse would stumble,
      there so soft that a horse would sink deep at each
      step.</p>
    <p>Ravenshaw had already turned out of the Canterbury
      road to the left, and was passing from a heath
      into a thick copse, when suddenly the narrow way
      before him became blocked with human creatures,
      or what seemed rather the remnants of human creatures,
      that limped out from among the trees at the
      sides.</p>
    <p>He drew in his horse quickly to avoid riding over
      any one, while the newcomers thronged about him
      with outstretched palms and whining cries:</p>
    <p>"Save your good worship, one little drop of
      money!" "A small piece of silver, for the love
      of God!" "Pity for a poor maimed soldier!"<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_252"
          name="Page_252">[252]</a></span>
      "A few pence to buy bread, kind gentleman!"
      "Charity for the lame and blind!"</p>
    <p>"Peace, peace, peace!" cried the captain. "What
      be these the greenwood vomits up? Hath the forest
      made a dinner of men, and cast up the pieces it could
      not stomach?"</p>
    <p>Pieces of men in truth they looked, and of two
      women also. All were in rags; the men had unkempt
      beards and hair; those that did not go upon
      crutches showed white eyes, or an empty sleeve, or
      great livid sores upon face and naked breast, or discoloured
      bandages; one of the women, fat and hoarse-voiced,
      went upon a single leg and a crutch; the
      other woman, a gaunt hag, petitioned with one skinny
      hand, and pointed with the other to her colourless
      eyeballs.</p>
    <p>"Let go; I am in haste; I have no money," said
      Ravenshaw, for one of the men&#8212;a white-bearded
      old fellow poised on his only foot&#8212;had taken firm
      hold of the bridle near the horse's mouth.</p>
    <p>But, so far from the man's letting go, some of his
      companions seized upon Ravenshaw's ankles, and the
      chorus of whines waxed louder and more urgent.
      With his free hand he reached for his dagger; but
      the lean woman, having already possessed herself of
      the handle, drew it from the sheath ere he knew what
      she was doing. He clapped his other hand to his
      sword-hilt; but his fingers closed around the two<span class="pagenum"><a
          id="Page_253" name="Page_253">[253]</a></span>
      hands of a dwarf on a man's shoulders, who had
      grasped the hilt, and who now thrust his head forward
      and caught the captain's knuckles between his
      jaws.</p>
    <p>"Oho!" exclaimed Ravenshaw, changing to a
      jovial manner. "I see I have walked into Beggars'
      Bush. Well, friends, I pray you believe me, I am a
      man wrung dry by war and ill fortune, and little less
      a beggar than any of ye. I have chanced upon a
      slight service will keep my body and soul together;
      if I lose time here I shall lose that. I have nothing
      but my weapons, which I need in my profession, and
      my clothes, which would not serve you in yours.
      The horse I require for my necessary haste, and&#8212;"</p>
    <p>"He lies, he lies!" shrieked the lean hag, striking
      the pocket of Ravenshaw's breeches. "Hearken
      to the chinking lour! A handful!"</p>
    <p>"A piece of gold for a poor maimed soldier!"
      cried the white-bearded man, whipping out a pistol
      from his wide breeches, whereupon other of the
      rogues brandished truncheons and staves. At sight
      of the clubs, Ravenshaw made a wry face, and his
      bruised body seemed to plead with him. He had
      one hand free, with which he might have seized the
      dwarf's neck, but he thought best to use it for holding
      the rein and guarding his pocket.</p>
    <p>"Ay, there's money in the pocket," he said; "but
      I spoke truth when I said I had none. This is not<span class="pagenum"><a
          id="Page_254" name="Page_254">[254]</a></span>
      mine; 'tis another man's, to whom I must pay it
      to-morrow."</p>
    <p>"Let the other man give us charity, then!" cried
      the fat woman.</p>
    <p>"Ay, we'd as lief have another man's money as
      yours," said the white-bearded rogue, aiming the
      pistol. The lean hag tried to force her hand into
      Ravenshaw's pocket, and men caught his clothing by
      the hooks at the ends of their staves.</p>
    <p>"Nay, maunderers!" cried Ravenshaw; "shall
      not a gentry cove that cuts ben whids, and hath
      respect for the salamon, pass upon the pad but ye
      would be foisting and angling?"&#8212;</p>
    <p>"Marry, you can cant," said the white-bearded
      beggar, his manner changing to one of approval,
      which spread at once to his associates.</p>
    <p>"As ben pedlar's French as any clapperdudgeon
      of ye all," replied the captain.</p>
    <p>"Belike you are a prigger of prancers," said the
      beggar, looking at the horse.</p>
    <p>"No, my upright man, a poor gentry cuffin, as I
      have said, but one that hath passed many a night out-of-doors,
      and now fallen into a little poor service that
      I am like to forfeit by my delay. As for the lour in
      my pocket, I am a forsworn man if I deliver it not
      to-morrow. So I beg, in the name of all the maunders
      I have stood friend to in my time&#8212;"</p>
    <p>"A ben cove," said the upright man. "Mort,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_255"
          name="Page_255">[255]</a></span>
      take off your fambles; brother rufflers, down with
      your filches and cudgels. By the salamon, the canting
      cuffin shall go free upon the pad."</p>
    <p>Released on every side, no more threatened, and
      his dagger restored to its sheath, the captain looked
      gratefully down upon the grotesque crew. As he
      did so, his nose became sensible of a faint, delicious
      odour, borne from a distance. He sniffed keenly.</p>
    <p>"Cackling-cheats," said the chief beggar. "Our
      doxies and dells are roasting 'em in a glade yonder.
      Plump young ones, and fresh. We filched 'em but
      last darkmans. We be toward a ben supper, and
      you are welcome,&#8212;though we lack bouze."</p>
    <p>The captain sighed. He had not dined; the fresh
      air of the country had whetted his stomach; roast
      chickens were good eating, hot or cold; and he had
      gathered, from the vague replies Jerningham had
      made to his inquiries about provisions, that his diet
      at the Grange would be a rather spare one of salt
      meat, stockfish, milk, and barley-cakes.</p>
    <p>"Alas, if I durst but tarry!" He looked to see
      how far behind him the sun was, and then shook his
      head and gathered up his reins. "I must hasten on&#8212;tis
      a sweet smell of cookery, forsooth!&#8212;how
      soon, think you, will they be roasted?"</p>
    <p>"Oh, half an hour, to be done properly."</p>
    <p>"Then I must e'en thank ye, and ride on. I
      durst not&#8212;" He broke off to sniff the air again.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_256"
          name="Page_256">[256]</a></span>
      "Marry, I have a thought. You lack bouze, say you?
      Now at the place whither I am bound, there is ale, or
      my gentleman has lied to me. I shall be in a sort
      the master there, with only a country wench and an
      old doting man&#8212;Know you Marshleigh Grange?"</p>
    <p>"Ay," spoke up a very old cripple; "the lone
      house 'twixt the hills and the marshes; there hath
      been no ben filching there this many a year; the
      wild rogues pass it by as too far from the pads;
      neither back nor belly-cheats to be angled there."</p>
    <p>Ravenshaw addressed himself again to the bearded
      chief of the beggars, received answer, passed a jovial
      compliment, and rode on alone in cheerful mood. In
      due time he turned into the by-road which accorded
      with Jerningham's description; and at length, emerging
      from a woody, bushy tract, he came upon a
      lonely plain wherein the one object for the eye was
      a gray-brown house, huddled against barn and outbuildings,
      at the left of the vanishing road,&#8212;a house
      of timber and plaster, warped and weather-beaten,
      its cracked gables offering a wan, long-suffering
      aspect to the sun and breeze. This was the Grange.</p>
    <p>A short canter brought Ravenshaw to the rude
      wooden gate, studded with nails, in the stone wall
      that separated the courtyard from the road, which
      here came to an end. Ere the captain had time to
      knock, or cry "Ho, within!" the gate swung inward
      on its crazy hinges, and a thin, bent old man, with<span class="pagenum"><a
          id="Page_257" name="Page_257">[257]</a></span>
      sparse white hair and blinking eyes, shambled forward
      to take the horse. At the same time, as
      further proof that Ravenshaw had been looked for,
      a woman appeared in the porched doorway of the
      house, and called out:</p>
    <p>"Jeremy will see to your horse. Come within."</p>
    <p>Ravenshaw looked at her with a little surprise;
      this robust, erect, full-coloured, well-shaped creature,
      upon whom common rustic clothes took a
      certain grace, and whose head stood back in the
      proud attitude natural to beauty, was scarce the
      country wench he had expected to meet. But he
      said nothing, and followed her into the hall. This
      was a wide, high apartment of some pretension, its
      ceiling, rafters, and walls being of oak. Bare enough,
      it yet had the appearance of serving as the chief
      living-room of the occupants of the house. Upon an
      oak table, at which was an old chair, stood a flagon
      of wine and some cakes. Meg offered Ravenshaw
      this repast by a gesture, while she scrutinised him
      with interest.</p>
    <p>"Wine?" quoth he, promptly setting to. "'Tis
      more than I had thought to find."</p>
    <p>"There is some left since the time when&#8212;when
      Master Jerningham used to come to the Grange
      oftener," said Meg. "Ale serves for me and old
      Jeremy."</p>
    <p>"Troth&#8212;your health, mistress!&#8212;I am glad you<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_258"
          name="Page_258">[258]</a></span>
      have ale in store. Would there be enough to entertain
      a few guests withal&#8212;some dozen or score poor
      friends of mine, if they were travelling this way?
      To tell the truth, I should not like to waste this wine
      upon such."</p>
    <p>"Travellers never pass this way," said Meg, plainly
      not knowing what to make of him.</p>
    <p>"Oh, we are some way from the highroad here, indeed;
      but a foolish friend or so might turn out a
      mile for the pleasure of my company."</p>
    <p>"I know not what you'd set before 'em to eat, if
      there were a dozen."</p>
    <p>"Marry, they would have to bring eatables with
      'em,&#8212;my reason for having 'em as guests. Only
      so there be ale enough."</p>
    <p>"Oh, there is ale," said Meg, without further
      comment.</p>
    <p>Ravenshaw, munching the cakes, and oft wetting
      his throat, looked around the hall. The front doorway
      faced a wide fireplace at the rear, now empty.
      At the right was a door to a small apartment, a kind
      of porter's room, lighted by a single high narrow
      window; farther back in the hall was the entrance
      to a passage communicating with other parts of the
      house; and still farther back, a door leading to the
      kitchen. At the left hand were, first, a door to a
      large room, and, second, the opening to a passage
      like that on the right.</p>
    <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">[259]</a></span></p>
    <p>By way of this left-hand passage, and a narrow
      staircase which led from it, the captain was presently
      shown by old Jeremy to his chamber. It was large
      and bare, hung with rotten arras, and contained a
      bed, a joint-stool, and a table with ewer and basin;
      its window looked into the courtyard.</p>
    <p>He flung his bruised body on the bed, and soon
      sank deliciously to sleep.</p>
    <p>Meanwhile old Jeremy, returning to the hall, found
      Meg sitting with her chin upon her hands, and gazing
      into the empty fireplace.</p>
    <p>"A sturdy fellow," whispered the old man, pointing
      backward with his thumb, and taking on a jocular
      air. "Cast eyes on him; a goodly husband mends
      all; cast eyes on him!"</p>
    <p>"Thou'rt a fool; go thy ways!" quoth Meg; but
      she did not move.</p>

    <h2><a id="CHAPTER_XVI" name="CHAPTER_XVI">CHAPTER XVI.</a></h2>
    <div class="center">THE POET AS A MAN OF ACTION.</div>
    <blockquote>
      <p>"O father, where's my love? were you so careless<br />
      To let an unthrift steal away your child?"<br />
      <br />
      &#8212;<i>The Case Is Altered.</i><br /></p>
    </blockquote>

    <p>Millicent, after the riot had ceased and dinner
      had been eaten, passed the day with a palpitating
      heart but a resolved mind. Under cover of her
      usual needlework, she fashioned a sort of large linen
      wallet, in which to carry the few things she wished
      to take with her. Her emotions were, in a less degree,
      similar to those which had affected her in the
      hours preceding her former attempt to run away.
      At supper she looked often with a hidden tenderness
      at the composed, unsuspecting face of her mother.
      When the light of evening faded she slipped to her
      chamber, and put a few chosen objects into the
      receptacle she had made, wrapped this in a hooded
      cloak, and dropped it from her window into the
      concealed space behind the garden shrubbery. She
      then waited, watching from the window that part
      of Friday Street in which Master Holyday must
      appear.</p>
    <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">[261]</a></span></p>
    <p>At last his slender figure lurched into view in the
      dusk, and came to a stop outside the gate.</p>
    <p>Millicent sped across her chamber. At the door
      she turned, with fast-beating heart, and cast an affectionate,
      tearful look at the place in which she had
      spent so much of her childhood and youth, and which
      seemed to share so many of her untold thoughts. It
      appeared for an instant to reproach her sorrowfully;
      but when in her swift thought she justified her
      action, its aspect changed to that of wishing her
      Godspeed, and counselling her to hasten.</p>
    <p>She hurried through the house as if upon some
      indoor quest, found herself alone in the garden, recovered
      her cloak and parcel, and went to unfasten
      the gate.</p>
    <p>"'Tis I, Master Holyday," she said, in a low tone,
      as she loosened the bolt.</p>
    <p>"Good! good! excellent!" came the scholar's
      reply from outside the gate, in a voice rather
      parched and excited.</p>
    <p>Having slid back the bolt, she made to pull the
      gate open, but it would not move.</p>
    <p>"What is the matter?" quoth she. "I cannot
      open it. Push it from your side."</p>
    <p>She heard his hands laid against it, then his
      shoulder, then his back. But it would not budge.
      She examined it closely in the dusky light, and suddenly
      gave a little cry of despair.</p>
    <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">[262]</a></span></p>
    <p>"Oh, me! There is a new lock on the gate, and
      God knows where is the key!"</p>
    <p>During the afternoon, in fact, Master Etheridge,
      alarmed by the easy entrance obtained by Ravenshaw
      and Gregory the previous night, and by
      Ravenshaw's exit from the garden that day,&#8212;an
      exit after which the gate had been left open,&#8212;had
      caused an additional lock to be put on, a lock to be
      opened by means of a key which the goldsmith
      thought best to keep in his own care.</p>
    <p>"Oh, what shall I do?" she cried, after a futile
      tug at the lock.</p>
    <p>"Is there no other way to come out?" queried
      Holyday, in perturbation.</p>
    <p>"Alas, no! There's the street door from the gallery,
      but my father locks it himself at supper-time
      and keeps the key. I durs'n't go through the shop;
      if it isn't closed, my father may be in the back shop
      and the apprentices will surely be in front."</p>
    <p>"God's name, I know not what&#8212;" began the
      poet, agitated with perplexity and fear of failure,
      but broke off to "Can't you make another pretext
      to go out?&#8212;drop another wedding-ring into the
      street, or something?"</p>
    <p>"Nay, they would sure stop my going or follow
      me out at this hour. Oh, would I could leap the
      wall! By St. Anne, 'tis too bad&#8212;Ha! wait a
      minute."</p>
    <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">[263]</a></span></p>
    <p>Under the impulse of her thought she sped away
      without listening for answer, unconscious that her
      last words had been spoken too low to go beyond the
      gate.</p>
    <p>Hence she did not know that Master Holyday,
      attacked by an idea at the same moment, and expressing
      himself with equal inaudibility, had as suddenly
      made off toward the White Horse Tavern.</p>
    <p>She was in the house ere it occurred to her that
      she ought to have rid herself of her burden by throwing
      it over the wall. She thought best not to retrace
      her steps. So she ran up-stairs and along the passage
      to a small window that looked down on Friday
      Street. She pushed open the casement, saw that no
      one was passing below, and dropped the parcel, trusting
      it to the darkness. She had a moment's idea of
      calling to Holyday to come and take it, but a second
      thought was wiser; she cast a single glance toward
      the gate, but was uncertain whether she made out
      his form or not in the decreasing light. Then she
      went down-stairs, and boldly into the back shop.
      Her father sat at his small table counting by
      candle-light the day's money.</p>
    <p>"Eh! what is it?" he asked, looking sharply up.
      "What dost thou here, baggage?"</p>
    <p>"I have an order for George," she replied, quietly,
      forcing her voice to steadiness, and praying that her
      throbbing heart and pale face might not betray her.</p>
    <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">[264]</a></span></p>
    <p>George was an apprentice whom, for his cleverness,
      Mistress Etheridge was wont to employ on errands.
      Millicent could see him now in the outer shop, busy
      with other apprentices in covering the cases and
      closing up the front.</p>
    <p>"'Zooks!" grumbled the goldsmith; "thy mother
      would best take the lad for a page, and be done
      with it."</p>
    <p>Millicent passed on to the front shop.</p>
    <p>"George," said she, when out of her father's
      hearing, but in that of one or two of the other
      apprentices, "you are to come with me to Mistress
      Carroll's next door; there is something to fetch back.
      Nay, wait till you have done here; I'll run ahead, 'tis
      but a step."</p>
    <p>Upon the hazard that her father, in the rear shop,
      would not lift up his eyes from his money for some
      little time, she passed out to Cheapside. In a breath
      she was around the corner, from the crowd and the
      window-lights, into the dusk and desertion of Friday
      Street. She stooped and picked up her cloak and
      bag; then ran on, to the gate.</p>
    <p>"Speed! speed! there's not a moment to lose!"
      she whispered, catching the elbow of the man who
      stood there, and who had not heard her coming
      swiftly up behind him.</p>
    <p>He turned and stared, putting his eyes close to
      hers on account of the darkness; she saw that he<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_265"
          name="Page_265">[265]</a></span>
      had a great, scarred, bearded face, and that his body
      was twice the breadth of Master Holyday's.</p>
    <p>"Oh, God!" she exclaimed, drawing back. "I
      thought you were Master Holyday."</p>
    <p>"Master Holyday, eh?" growled the man. "What
      of him?"</p>
    <p>"I&#8212;I was to meet him here," she faltered, looking
      around with a sinking heart.</p>
    <p>"Oh!&#8212;God's light!&#8212;you are the maid, belike?
      Well, troth, beshrew me but that's the
      hell of it!" And the fellow grinned with silent
      laughter.</p>
    <p>"What mean you? What maid? Know you
      aught&#8212;?"</p>
    <p>"Of Master Holyday? Sooth, do I! He's on
      t'other side of this gate."</p>
    <p>She stared at the closed gate in bewilderment.
      "What? In the garden?"</p>
    <p>"Ay, in the garden." The man raised his voice a
      little. "Sure thou'rt there, Master Holyday?"</p>
    <p>"Ay," came the reply in the scholar's unmistakable
      voice. "But the maid is not. Hang her,
      whither is she gone?"</p>
    <p>"Here I am," answered the maid, for herself.
      "In God's name, how got you in there?"</p>
    <p>"In God's name, how got you out there?" said
      Holyday, vexatiously. "A minute ago you were
      here, and I was there. You could not come out, so<span class="pagenum"><a
          id="Page_266" name="Page_266">[266]</a></span>
      I went for this gentleman, who lifted me to the top
      of the wall&#8212;"</p>
    <p>"Which was a service not included in the contract,"
      remarked Cutting Tom.</p>
    <p>"And here I dropped, thinking to find you,"
      continued Holyday, in exasperation, "and to help you
      out as he helped me in. And now&#8212;"</p>
    <p>"Well, I am out, nevertheless," she replied,
      quickly. "So come you out, pray, without more
      ado; my father may discover at any moment&#8212;"</p>
    <p>"Why, devil take me!" cried Holyday, in despair.
      "I cannot climb the wall; there's none here to give
      me a shoulder."</p>
    <p>"Is there nothing there you can climb upon?"
      queried Cutting Tom.</p>
    <p>"Yes," cried Millicent, taking the answer upon
      herself; "there are benches. Oh, pray, make haste,
      Master Holyday!"</p>
    <p>Soon Master Holyday could be heard dragging a
      bench across the sward; in its ordinary position
      it would not give him sufficient height, so he
      seemed to busy himself in placing it properly for
      his purpose. "<i>Nomine patris!</i>" he exclaimed as he
      bruised his fingers. Finally a thud against the
      upper part of the gate indicated that he had
      fixed the bench slantwise. Mounting the incline
      chiefly by means of hands and knees, he stood
      trembling at the top, high enough to get a purchase<span class="pagenum"><a
          id="Page_267" name="Page_267">[267]</a></span>
      of his elbows on the gate, and so to wriggle his body
      over.</p>
    <p>Millicent breathed more freely as soon as his head
      and shoulders appeared; but, as he was righting himself
      on the gate-top in order to drop safely outside,
      there came a voice from within the garden:</p>
    <p>"Hey? How now? Good lack, more comings
      and goings!"</p>
    <p>"Oh, God! that meddling Sir Peregrine!" cried
      Millicent. "We are found out. Hurry, Master
      Holyday!"</p>
    <p>The poet, startled, was still upon the gate, staring
      back into the garden. With a revival of earlier
      agility, the old knight came up the sloping bench at
      a run, took hold of the gate's top with one hand, and
      of Master Holyday's neck with the other. His eyes
      fell upon the pair waiting outside. It was not too
      dark for him to recognise a figure which he had oft
      observed with the interest of future ownership.</p>
    <p>"What! Mistress Millicent! And who's this?
      Master Holyday, o' my life! 'Zooks and 'zounds!
      here's doings!"</p>
    <p>The poet, suddenly alive, jerked his neck from the
      old knight's grasp, and threw himself from the gate
      without thought of consequences. Luckily, Tom
      caught him by the body, and saved his neck, though
      both men were heavily jarred by the collision.</p>
    <p>"Come!" cried Millicent, seizing Holyday by the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_268"
          name="Page_268">[268]</a></span>
      sleeve ere he had got his balance. She darted down
      Friday Street, the poet staggering headlong after
      her, Cutting Tom close in the rear.</p>
    <p>"What, ho!" cried Sir Peregrine, astonished out
      of his wits. "Stop! stay! The watch! constables!
      Master Etheridge! Runaways, runaways, runaways!"</p>
    <p>His voice waned in the distance behind Millicent
      as she hastened on. She still held the poet's sleeve;
      he breathed fast and hard, but said nothing. In
      front of the White Horse, four men, at a gruff word
      from Cutting Tom, fell in with the fugitives, and the
      whole party of seven ran on without further speech.
      For a short time, tramping and breathing were the
      only sounds in Millicent's ears; but soon there came
      a renewed and multiplied cry of "Runaways! stop
      them!" whereby she knew that Sir Peregrine had
      given the alarm, and that her father and his lads had
      started in pursuit.</p>
    <p>"God send we get to the boat in time!" she said,
      as she halted for a single step so that Master Holyday
      might take the lead. She cast a swift look over
      her shoulder, and saw two or three torches flaring in
      the distance.</p>
    <p>Holyday led across Knightrider Street obliquely,
      then down the lower part of Bread Street, along a
      little of Thames Street, and through a short passage
      to Queenhithe. This wharf enclosed three sides
      of a somewhat rounded basin, wherein a number of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_269"
          name="Page_269">[269]</a></span>
      craft now lay at rest in the black water that lapped
      softly as stirred by the tide and a light wind.
      Houses were built close together on all three sides.</p>
    <p>The poet made straight along the east side of the
      basin, and down a narrow flight of stairs to a large
      boat that lay there. A man started up in the boat,
      and held out his hand to help the maid aboard, lighting
      her steps with a lantern in his other hand,&#8212;for
      a veil of clouds had swept across the sky from the
      west, and the only considerable light upon the wharf
      was from a lantern before one of the gabled houses,
      and from the lattice windows of a tavern. Other
      boatmen steadied the vessel, so that Millicent
      boarded without accident; Holyday, coming next,
      and setting foot blindly upon the gunwale, rather
      fell than stepped in. Cutting Tom and his men huddled
      aboard, and the whole party crowded together
      astern, to leave room forward for the rowers.</p>
    <p>"Whither?" asked the waterman in command.</p>
    <p>"Why, down-stream, of course," replied Holyday.
      "Know you not&#8212;how now? Where is Bill
      Tooby?"</p>
    <p>"Bill Tooby? He is yonder in his boat, waiting
      for some that have bespoke him." The man pointed
      across the basin.</p>
    <p>Holyday was stricken faint of voice. "Oh,
      <i>miserere</i>!" he wailed. "He is waiting for us.
      We have come to the wrong stairs."</p>
    <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">[270]</a></span></p>
    <p>"Hark!" cried Millicent.</p>
    <p>Cries of "Runaways! Stop them! Stop the
      maid!" were approaching from, apparently, the
      vicinity of Knightrider Street.</p>
    <p>"We must e'en change to the other boat," said
      Holyday, despairingly.</p>
    <p>"Oh, heaven, there is not time!" cried Millicent.</p>
    <p>"If you be in haste," said the waterman, "stay
      where ye are. Whither shall we carry ye?"</p>
    <p>"Nay, nay, I durst not!" cried Holyday, and yet
      stood in helpless indecision.</p>
    <p>"Come, then!" said Millicent, and leaped from
      the boat to the stairs. Reaching back for Holyday's
      hand, she pulled him after her, dragged him up the
      steps, and led him around the three sides of the
      basin, their five protectors following close.</p>
    <p>A larger boat, manned with a more numerous
      crew, was in waiting at the western stairs. The
      waterman with whom Ravenshaw had bargained in
      the morning, making sure of Holyday's face in the
      light of a lantern, guided the fugitives aboard with
      orderly swiftness. But already the noise of pursuit
      was in Thames Street; ere the last man&#8212;a slim
      fellow with a thickly bearded face, which he carried
      well forward from his body&#8212;was embarked, the
      cries, swelling suddenly as the pursuers emerged
      from the narrow passage, were upon the wharf,
      and the red flare of torches came with them.</p>
    <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">[271]</a></span></p>
    <p>The party in chase was headed by the goldsmith
      himself, no covering on his head, his gray
      hair standing out in the breeze; then came his
      apprentices, and sundry persons who had joined in
      the hue and cry; the rear was brought up by Sir
      Peregrine, lamed and winded. Master Etheridge
      made out the party in the boat at once, and, with
      threatening commands to the waterman to stop, led
      his people around to the stairs.</p>
    <p>"Cast off!" growled Bill Tooby, the waterman,
      pulling the slim fellow aboard. The order was
      obeyed, and Millicent, who had sat more dead than
      alive since her father had come into sight, saw
      the wharf recede, and a strip of black water spread
      between the boat and the torch-lit party that stood
      gazing from the stairs.</p>
    <p>"Oh, wench, I'll make thee rue this day!" cried
      the goldsmith, shaking his arms after the boat. As
      for Sir Peregrine, he looked utterly nonplussed.</p>
    <p>Then her father spoke hurriedly to his followers,
      and called loudly for a boat. The waterman to
      whom Holyday had first led his own party was quick
      to respond. Meanwhile Tooby's craft headed down-stream.
      Millicent, looking anxiously back over the
      water, saw the other boat, or its lantern and one of
      the torches, shoot out from the stairs.</p>
    <p>"Think you they will catch us?" she asked Master
      Holyday.</p>
    <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">[272]</a></span></p>
    <p>"I think nothing," said the poet, dejectedly,
      really thinking very small of himself for the mistake
      which had enabled the goldsmith to come upon their
      heels.</p>
    <p>Surprised at the apparent change in Master Holyday
      since the forenoon, she turned to Tooby. "What
      think you, waterman?"</p>
    <p>"Why, mistress, an they make better speed than
      we, belike they'll catch us; but, an we make better
      speed than they, belike they'll not catch us," growled
      Tooby.</p>
    <p>"And that's the hell of it!" quoth Cutting Tom.</p>

    <div class="center">DIRE THINGS BEFALL IN THE FOREST.</div>

      <blockquote><p>"'Mistress, it grows somewhat pretty and dark.'<br />
      'What then?'<br />
      'Nay, nothing. Do not think I am afraid,<br />
      Although perhaps you are.'"&#8212;<i>Beggars' Bush.</i><br /></p></blockquote>

    <p>The two large boats were not alone upon the
      river. Here and there, in the distance, moved
      the tiny lights of a wherry carrying a benighted
      fare; and up toward the palaces and Westminster
      more than one cluster of lanterns and torches swept
      along, where some party of ladies and gentlemen
      were rowed to a mask or other revels. From one
      such company the western breeze brought the strains
      of guitars; Bill Tooby and his comrades, infected
      with the spirit of melody, began to sing "Heave and
      ho, rumbelow," in deep voices, in time with the
      movement of their bodies.</p>
    <p>Along the northern bank of the river, where
      the dwellings and warehouses of merchants rose
      like a wall from the water's edge, the dim lights of
      windows ran in a straggling, interrupted line. Farther
      west, where the river washed the stairs to
      the gardens of the great Strand residences and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_274"
          name="Page_274">[274]</a></span>
      of the Temple, there were scarce any lights at
      all. On the south bank, a few glowing windows
      marked the row of taverns and other houses&#8212;many
      of them of questionable repute&#8212;which, set back
      a little from the river, concealed the bear-gardens
      and playhouses in the fields behind. But soon, as
      the boat sped down-stream, the buildings on that
      bank were flush with the shore, save where Winchester
      House showed a few lighted windows beyond its
      terrace. Little did Millicent imagine that anything
      bearing upon her destiny had ever been spoken or
      thought on that terrace or in that house. In front,
      spanning the river, another irregular row of window
      lights indicated the tall, close-built houses of London
      Bridge; and the roar of the water, first dammed by
      the piers and then falling in a kind of cataract
      through the twenty arches, was already loud in
      the ears.</p>
    <p>Millicent kept her eyes on the lights of the boat
      behind,&#8212;only two lights, a lantern at the prow, and
      a torch held by some one near the stern. They
      came steadily on, seeming neither to lose nor gain.
      Suddenly she lost sense of them; but that was when
      her own boat plunged into one of the arches of the
      bridge, and seemed to be gulped down by a blacker
      night, a chill air, and a thunderous noise. Forward
      and slightly downward the boat flung itself, as if into
      some gulf of the underworld, but all of a sudden it<span class="pagenum"><a
          id="Page_275" name="Page_275">[275]</a></span>
      was out again in the soft air and the calm water, and
      Millicent, looking up, saw the lit windows of the
      eastern side of the bridge. She continued gazing
      back, and very soon the two lights, the little yellow
      one and the trailing red one, came into view between
      the piers, still in pursuit at the same distance.</p>
    <p>"They don't gain upon us," growled Cutting Tom,
      with a desire of making himself agreeable to the
      maid.</p>
    <p>"But they do not lose," said Millicent, in a troubled
      tone.</p>
    <p>"Why, sooth, an they still gain not, 'tis sure
      they'll ne'er catch us."</p>
    <p>"But they can see where we land," said she, "and
      they can land there, too, and so follow us to the end."</p>
    <p>"Then we can e'en teach 'em better manners,"
      said Tom, grandly. "I'd as lief split a throat this
      night as another."</p>
    <p>"Oh, no; in heaven's name, no!" she cried.
      "We must escape them without that. No blows,
      I beg of you, whate'er befall!"</p>
    <p>"Yet you see how they stick to our heels. How
      is it, waterman? Shall we not give 'em the slip
      soon?"</p>
    <p>"Belike, and belike not," replied Tooby. "We
      can do our best, no more."</p>
    <p>Suddenly Master Holyday, thinking in some manner
      to redeem himself, had an inspiration.</p>
    <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">[276]</a></span></p>
    <p>"How if they couldn't see to follow us?" he
      asked, abruptly. "How if we put out our lights and
      went on in the dark?"</p>
    <p>"Not for ten pound a minute," said Tooby,
      "would I row without lights, a night like this. 'Tis
      bad enow as it is, with all the ships and small boats
      lying in the Pool here. E'en with our lanterns, we
      shall do well an we bump not our nose."</p>
    <p>There was a silence, broken only by the plash of
      the oars, the creak of the rowlocks, the strange
      noises of the river, the lessening sound of what an
      obscure dramatist of those days describes as</p>
    <p>
      "The bridge's cataracts, and such-like murmurs<br />
      As night and sleep yield from a populous number."<br />
    </p>
    <p>"But I will e'en try something better," added
      Tooby, presently, and forthwith gave an inaudible
      order to his men.</p>
    <p>They instantly stopped rowing, and even proceeded
      to stay the boat's movement with the current, so
      that it remained almost stationary.</p>
    <p>Millicent cried out in alarm as the lights behind
      came rapidly nearer.</p>
    <p>"Peace, mistress," said Tooby. "There will be
      no blood spilled." He then spoke in a low tone to
      the men in the bow, and himself strode to the stern,
      where he stood with his long arms slightly crooked
      at the elbows as if to be in readiness for action.</p>
    <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">[277]</a></span></p>
    <p>Swiftly the other boat came alongside. Millicent,
      holding her breath, wondering what was about to
      occur, made out her father bending forward in the
      attitude of one ready to grasp and punish. The
      torch revealed Sir Peregrine also, limply huddled up
      so that his beard was between his knees, and two
      of the apprentices, one of whom held the torch.</p>
    <p>"Ay, thou dost well to yield, wench!" spake the
      goldsmith, in tones so wrathful as rather to contradict
      his words.</p>
    <p>"Ay, chick," called out Sir Peregrine, reassuringly,
      "no need to run away from me; I'll give thee no
      cause for jealousy, I promise thee."</p>
    <p>Master Etheridge stood up to reach out for his
      daughter. She had a fearful thought that Tooby
      had chosen to betray her. But at the same instant
      Tooby, leaning over to the other boat, violently
      struck the torch-bearing apprentice's hand, and
      deftly caught the torch away. She heard a slight
      crash forward; and then her own boat shot through
      the water, leaving the other in complete darkness,
      one of Tooby's men having knocked the lantern
      from its prow with an oar.</p>
    <p>Millicent gave a quick breath of relief and put on
      her cloak; but then she thought of the other boat's
      danger of running into something, or of being run
      down itself, and of this she spoke.</p>
    <p>"Never fear," said Tooby. "He'll no more ven<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_278"
          name="Page_278">[278]</a></span>ture
      in the dark than I would. We'll fast put yon
      ship's hull 'twixt them and us, and be out of their
      ken ere ever they can get a light. And now pull,
      hearts, for the honour of watermen!"</p>
    <p>Soon the lights on the left bank, becoming fewer,
      took such height and shape that Millicent knew her
      boat was passing the Tower. Somewhere there the
      water plashed against the underground stairs of
      Traitors' Gate, that arched cavern which had lifted
      its iron door often in nights as dark as this, to admit
      some noble prisoner whose face, redly pale in the
      torchlight, betokened a heart chilled with a feeling
      that those damp walls formed a vestibule of death.
      Master Holyday, for all that was upon his mind,
      thought of these things, and of much else in the
      night-clad surroundings; but Millicent kept her eyes
      fixed on the darkness behind, alert for any moving
      light that might appear in chase.</p>
    <p>None such appeared; and by the time the boat
      had traversed the city of great ships, and had come
      to where the lights upon the banks were few, and
      the mysterious noises of the town had given place to
      those of the country, she had cast away all fear of
      danger from behind.</p>
    <p>At Deptford they passed one ship, of which Millicent
      took no more note than she took of any other of
      the countless vessels whose lights dotted the gloom
      around her that night; but on which she might have<span class="pagenum"><a
          id="Page_279" name="Page_279">[279]</a></span>
      bestowed a second look had she known all that was
      to be known.</p>
    <p>The tide, the current, and the wind being with the
      rowers, it seemed not long till Tooby hinted that
      Master Holyday would do well to keep his eyes open
      for the place of landing. The scholar, scanning the
      blue-black darkness in perplexity, said that he could
      not for his life see anything of the shore. Tooby
      asked him whether he knew the different landmarks
      by name. The scholar was acquainted with those
      in the neighbourhood of where they should land.
      Thenceforth the waterman called out the name of
      each village, wharf, riverside tavern, hill, tributary, or
      well-known country-seat, the contents of the darkness
      being known to him perhaps by his sense of distance,
      perhaps by reference to some far-off light, perhaps
      sometimes by the smell of marsh or wood. Holyday
      began to recognise the names; and at last told the
      waterman to put ashore at the mouth of a certain
      creek.</p>
    <p>The boat glided along a low bank and stopped.
      Tooby, standing up, held out his lantern to show
      where there was safe footing. Master Holyday,
      leaping out too hastily, alighted up to his knees in
      water. Millicent, aided by the waterman's hand,
      stepped ashore. Cutting Tom and his men lost no
      time. Ere it seemed possible, the lights of the boat
      were moving swiftly away. Its departure, and espe<span class="pagenum"><a
          id="Page_280" name="Page_280">[280]</a></span>cially
      that of Tooby, left Millicent with a sudden
      pang of loneliness and misgiving. But she reflected
      that the last stage of her flight was reached; taking
      new heart, she grasped Holyday's sleeve, and waited
      to be led.</p>
    <p>The party had two lanterns and a torch, all which
      had been lighted in the boat. Cutting Tom assigned
      one lantern to Holyday, the other to the slim fellow
      with the projecting head, the torch to himself. The
      poet, with a deep sigh, and craning his neck to
      peer into the mysterious blackness beyond the little
      area of feeble light, started forward; Millicent
      clung to his elbow; Cutting Tom placed himself at
      her other side, and the four men followed close.</p>
    <p>The walkers proceeded slowly, Master Holyday
      having often to stop to ascertain his way. At first
      the turf under them was springy, then it became
      softer, and sometimes one's foot would sink into a
      tiny pool; then the ground became higher, and presently
      they entered a wood. This seemed interminable;
      not only was poor Master Holyday compelled
      to pause every minute to identify his whereabouts
      but also the protruding roots, fallen boughs, and
      frequent underbrush made every step a matter of
      care.</p>
    <p>As they moved their torch and lanterns, so the
      light and shadow constantly moved about them;
      trunks and boughs, bush and brake, would suddenly<span class="pagenum"><a
          id="Page_281" name="Page_281">[281]</a></span>
      appear and as quickly vanish as the yellow rays
      swung here and there. The breeze rustled unceasingly
      among the leaves, and the air was pleasant with
      forest odours. Millicent's fancy peopled the shades
      with sleeping giants, goblins, witches, dragons, and all
      the creatures of the old tales of fairies and knights
      errant. She thought a similar terror must have
      come upon the others; her companion hesitated so
      when he strove to pierce the shadows with wide-open
      eyes; and Cutting Tom kept so close to her; while
      one of the men had stepped up to the other side of
      Holyday and tightly grasped his arm.</p>
    <p>"'Tis a weary journey, mistress," complained the
      poet.</p>
    <p>"Nay, I find it pleasant sport," said she, feeling
      that one of the two must show a light heart. Holyday's
      manner all evening had been so at variance
      with his readiness to fight a dangerous man some
      hours earlier, that she made no attempt to understand
      the alteration; she merely attended to the need of
      keeping up his spirits, though her own heart faltered.
      But she could not help adding: "Is there much more
      of this wood to go through?"</p>
    <p>"More than I wish there were," replied Holyday.</p>
    <p>They went some distance farther in silence. Then
      the slim fellow with a lantern suddenly gave two
      coughs. Instantly Cutting Tom gripped Millicent's
      arm, stood still, and said to Holyday:</p>
    <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">[282]</a></span></p>
    <p>"A plague on your eyes, sir! you are leading us
      the wrong way."</p>
    <p>Holyday, stopping perforce with all the rest, replied,
      in amazement: "'Tis the right way; I have
      come by this path to fish in the Thames a hundred
      times."</p>
    <p>"Poh! fish me no fish, sir!" cried Cutting Tom,
      while the slim lantern-bearer strode around to the
      front. "Am I to be led astray, and this maid here,
      for your designs? You have dragged us too long
      through this cursed wood&#8212;and that's the hell of it!"</p>
    <p>"'Tis the right way, I tell you," said Holyday;
      "and how can you say otherwise, when you know
      not whither we are bound?"</p>
    <p>"But I do know whither we are bound&#8212;and
      that's the hell of it!"</p>
    <p>"I begin to think you are an impudent fellow,"
      quoth Holyday, momentarily reckless through loss of
      patience; "and <i>that's</i> the hell of it, in your Bedlam
      gibberish!"</p>
    <p>"Death!" bellowed Cutting Tom; "'hell of it'
      belongs to me; no man in England dare steal my
      speech!"</p>
    <p>He handed his torch to one of the men, ran at the
      scholar, dealt him a blow between the eyes, seized
      his lantern, and dragged Millicent away, motioning
      the slim knave to lead on. The knave took a direction
      leftward from their former one.</p>
    <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">[283]</a></span></p>
    <p>"What mean you?" cried the maid, trying to
      release herself. "I'll not leave Master Holyday."</p>
    <p>One of the men caught her by the free arm, and
      she was borne away by him and Cutting Tom. Glancing
      back, she saw that the two remaining men, one
      of whom had quickly stuck the torch in the ground,
      were grappling with Holyday, who was struggling
      between them.</p>
    <p>"In God's name, what would you do?" Millicent
      cried, as her captors hastened on at the heels of the
      new guide.</p>
    <p>The men vouchsafed no answer. After a little
      while, at a word from Cutting Tom, they stopped
      and waited. Tom gave a whistle, which was answered
      from the direction whence they had last come,&#8212;evidently
      by one of the men who had remained with
      Holyday. Being at intervals repeated, and answered
      at lessening distances, the whistle proved to be for
      the purpose of guiding these two men. Soon they
      appeared with the torch, but without Holyday.</p>
    <p>"Oh, heaven! what have you done with him?"
      cried Millicent, turning cold.</p>
    <p>"Only lightened him of these, lady," said one of
      the twain, indicating a bundle of clothing under his
      arm.</p>
    <p>"And left him tied safe to a tree, lest he roam
      about i' the dark and do himself an injury," quoth
      the other.</p>
    <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">[284]</a></span></p>
    <p>"Come," said Tom, tightening his grasp on the
      girl's arm. The guide moved on, and the party
      made haste through the forest.</p>
    <p>"Whither are you taking me?" Millicent asked,
      tearfully, but got no reply. Wondering and appalled,
      scarce believing she was herself, oft doubting
      the reality of this strange journey, she walked as she
      was compelled.</p>
    <p>At last they came out of the wood and made their
      way over a flat, heathy plain. It seemed to Millicent
      that they had worked back to the neighbourhood
      of the river. Cutting Tom grew impatient, muttered
      to himself, and presently asked: "How far now?"</p>
    <p>"'Tis straight before us," said the guide, in a voice
      muffled as if by the heavy beard that covered his
      face.</p>
    <p>A narrow rift in the clouds let through a moment's
      moonlight; Millicent had a brief vision of lonely
      country, with a little cluster of gables ahead; then
      all was blotted out in thicker darkness.</p>

    <p>RAVENSHAW'S SLEEP IS INTERRUPTED.</p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>"Captain, rally up your rotten regiment, and begone."&#8212;<i>A King and No
          King.</i></p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>Master Jerningham, having communicated his
      good hopes to Sir Clement Ermsby on the deck of
      his ship, considered that, as the maid was not to
      leave London till nightfall, and, as he was now between
      London and the Grange, he had ample time to
      reach his country-house and send away the captain
      ere she could be brought there by her escort. He
      therefore resolved to proceed with leisure and order.
      And first, as he had long fasted, and as he had a
      night's business before him, he went ashore to his
      accustomed tavern at Deptford, and had supper with
      Sir Clement in a room where they were alone.</p>
    <p>"We shall take one of our own boats and four of
      our men," said Jerningham, "and row down to the
      old landing at the Grange. 'Tis but a short walk
      thence to the house. You and two of the men
      would best wait without the house, whilst I go in
      and send away Ravenshaw. If he saw you and so
      many men he might smell some extraordinary busi<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_286"
          name="Page_286">[286]</a></span>ness,
      and have the curiosity to set himself against
      my orders."</p>
    <p>"If he should do so, nevertheless," said Ermsby,
      "then, as you said awhile ago&#8212;You may want
      our help in that."</p>
    <p>"Then I must e'en call you. But I shall try to
      have him without his weapons."</p>
    <p>"What would Mistress Meg say to another ghost
      in the house?"</p>
    <p>"Hang her, mad wench! Ay, she would be howling
      of murder and blood. I know not&#8212;she might
      fly to my lord bishop with the news. Well, I can
      tie her up and lock her in a chamber, at the worst.
      Yet she is a very devil. I think I'd best breed no
      more trouble at the last. I'll not have the knave
      killed unless he cannot be got away otherwise."</p>
    <p>"An you send him away, will you leave some one
      in his place?"</p>
    <p>"Ay, to keep Meg quiet till we are safe at sea.
      I'll leave Meadows, and charge him not to tell her
      of our sailing. He is a trusty fool."</p>
    <p>"But what will she say to this goldsmith's wench
      being housed overnight in the Grange?"</p>
    <p>"Why, I'll have a tale ready when we arrive:
      that I am saving the maid from a runaway marriage,
      to take back to her father; or that the maid is for
      you; or some such story."</p>
    <p>"Best say the maid is for me. Women who<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_287"
          name="Page_287">[287]</a></span>
      have gone that road are ever ready to push others
      into it."</p>
    <p>"Not always. But I shall contrive to make Meg
      tolerate the other's presence for a few hours, e'en
      if I must do it with promises. I can offer to find
      her a husband,&#8212;this Ravenshaw, an she like his
      looks, or another that may be bought. I think she
      has grown out of her sulks, and into the hope of
      rehabilitation, by this time. As for the Cheapside
      maid, first I will try wooing; she may be compliant
      of her own accord. But if she hold out, there's
      nothing for it but the sleeping potion. Gregory
      will fetch that with him; I bade him get it in Bucklersbury
      on his way to Friday Street."</p>
    <p>"May it give her pleasant dreams!"</p>
    <p>"When she is fast asleep," continued Jerningham,
      "I'll leave Gregory to watch her, and we'll come
      back to welcome my lord bishop in the morning.
      And to-morrow, when my lord has seen the last of
      us, and the tide is bearing us down the river, we
      need only put the ship to at the old landing, walk to
      the house, and carry her aboard. There will be
      none to see but Meg and old Jeremy, and they shall
      not know the ship is ours, or that we are farther
      bound than Tilbury."</p>
    <p>Sir Clement's appetite, which had been less
      neglected of late, was satisfied before Jerningham's,
      and the knight proposed that he should go and get<span class="pagenum"><a
          id="Page_288" name="Page_288">[288]</a></span>
      the boat in readiness while the other finished eating.
      Jerningham consented, naming the men who were to
      be taken from the ship's crew upon the night's
      business.</p>
    <p>"I will join you very soon," said he, as Sir Clement
      left the room.</p>
    <p>Jerningham brought his supper to an end, and
      bade a drawer fetch the reckoning. Waiting for
      the boy's return, he flung himself on his back on
      a bench that stood against the wall. The knowledge
      that all was provided for, that his course was fully
      thought out, and that only action lay before him,
      brought to his mind a restfulness it had not lately
      known. The effect of his heavy meal acted with this
      to snare his senses; so long it was since sleep had
      overtaken him, he was not on guard against it. When
      the tavern lad came back with the score, the gentleman's
      eyes were closed, his breathing was slow and
      deep. Knowing by experience that sleeping gentlemen
      sometimes resented disturbance, the drawer
      went away more quietly than he had entered; Master
      Jerningham was a good customer, and might as
      well pay last as first.</p>
    <p>Sir Clement saw the boat ready, and then busied
      himself in the study of maps and charts by candle-light
      in the cabin, pending Jerningham's appearance.
      In his preoccupation, he lost thought of the night's
      affair, in which Jerningham bore all the responsi<span class="pagenum"><a
          id="Page_289" name="Page_289">[289]</a></span>bility.
      He took no observance of the increasing
      darkness outside, until at last he became wonderingly
      sensible of Jerningham's delay. Hastening
      ashore, he found the sleeper in the tavern.</p>
    <p>"Good God!" cried Jerningham, springing up at
      his friend's call; "what's the hour? How long have
      I slept? Death! is all lost?"</p>
    <p>"Nay, there is time, if we bestir ourselves."</p>
    <p>"Then we must fly. My plans are all undone if
      she be there before I send away that captain."</p>
    <p>Learning what o'clock it was, Jerningham found
      he had yet time to write a short pretended letter, to
      serve as pretext for Ravenshaw's journey. This
      done, he hastened to the boat.</p>
    <p>Not until he was being rowed past Blackwall, did
      it occur to him that, in the haste of departure, he
      had not looked to the thorough arming of the party,
      and that there was not a firearm with the whole
      company.</p>
    <p>"Oh, pish! there is steel enough among us to cut
      eight captains' throats with a clean blade apiece, an
      it comes to throat-cutting," said Ermsby.</p>
    <p>"'Twould come to that soon enough, but for the
      storm Meg would raise. Plague take her! would I
      had the heart to quiet her the sure way! But I cannot
      steel myself to that. I must be led by circumstance;
      'tis for this captain's doings to say whether
      his throat need be cut. He had no pistol when he<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_290"
          name="Page_290">[290]</a></span>
      left me. As for his sword and dagger"&#8212;here Jerningham
      raised his voice and called to one of the men
      rowing: "Goodcole, thou hast some skill in sleights,
      and cutting purses, and the like, I have heard."</p>
    <p>"Ay, sir," was the confident reply. "In my time
      I have been called the knave with the invisible
      fingers. My friends used to say I could filch a
      man's shirt off his back while he stood talking to
      me in the street."</p>
    <p>"Poh!" growled another of the men; "I much
      doubt whether you can pick a pocket."</p>
    <p>"Here's a handful of testers I picked from yours,"
      said Goodcole, resting his oar for a moment that he
      might return his comrade the coins.</p>
    <p>There was a brief stoppage from rowing while the
      other men hastily investigated the condition of their
      own pockets.</p>
    <p>"Excellent Goodcole!" quoth Sir Clement Ermsby.
      "Thou art a proficient in a most delicate craft."</p>
    <p>"Thou couldst take away a man's sword and
      dagger ere he knew it, belike," said Jerningham.</p>
    <p>"I could take away his teeth, or the thoughts in
      the centre of his head," promptly answered Goodcole.</p>
    <p>"Perchance I shall put thee to the test by and
      by," said Jerningham.</p>
    <p>In good time they found the landing with their
      lights, made the boat fast, and hastened through the<span class="pagenum"><a
          id="Page_291" name="Page_291">[291]</a></span>
      darkness to the country-house. The gate of the
      courtyard was not fastened. Jerningham first led
      the way to a small penthouse in one corner of the
      yard, where he desired that Sir Clement and two of
      the men should remain until he saw how the captain
      took the new commands.</p>
    <p>"And e'en when the maid is brought," he added,
      with a sudden afterthought, "best you be not seen
      at the first; wait till I try whether she is to be won
      softly. If she saw you she might remember that
      night, and be thrown into greater fear and opposition.
      I'll call when I have need of you."</p>
    <p>He then went with Meadows and Goodcole to the
      door within the porch; finding it made fast inside,
      he gave two rapid double knocks, then two single
      ones. Soon a tiny wicket opened behind a little
      grating in the door. Jerningham held a lantern
      close to his face so that he might be quickly recognised.
      The door opened, and Jerningham found
      Mistress Meg alone in the hall, where the light of
      a single candle struggled with the darkness. The
      lantern and torch brought in by the newcomers
      were a welcome reinforcement. Jerningham set the
      lantern on the chimney shelf, and had the torch
      thrust into a sconce on the wall.</p>
    <p>"Did the new steward come?" he asked.</p>
    <p>"The new steward?" quoth Meg, with faint
      derision at the title. "Yes; am I not still here?"</p>
    <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292">[292]</a></span></p>
    <p>"Where is he?" asked the master, ignoring the
      allusion to her threat.</p>
    <p>"In his chamber. He arrived, ate, drank, went
      thither; and I have not seen him since."</p>
    <p>A sudden light came into Jerningham's eyes.
      "Ten to one he sleeps. He had a laborious day
      of it ere he came hither. What weapons had he
      when he came?"</p>
    <p>"Rapier and dagger," answered Meg, looking surprised
      at the question.</p>
    <p>"'Twere a good jest now," said Jerningham, pretending
      amusement, "to take them from him in his
      sleep, then come away and send Jeremy to wake
      him."</p>
    <p>"Is he the kind of man to see the mirth of that
      jest?" inquired Meg, with little interest.</p>
    <p>"We shall see if he be. Goodcole, a chance to
      prove your mettle. Where's Jeremy? Pray send
      him to me, mistress, and I'll thank you."</p>
    <p>While Meg was at the kitchen door calling the old
      man-servant, Jerningham spoke quietly to Goodcole.
      Jeremy appeared, blinking and bowing; as he passed
      Meg, he chuckled, and said, in undertone, "A husband
      mends all, sooth!" Master Jerningham, ascertaining
      from Meg what chamber the captain lay in,
      bade the old man show Goodcole the way. The pair
      took a lantern, of which Goodcole concealed all but
      a small part in his jerkin.</p>
    <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_293" id="Page_293">[293]</a></span></p>
    <p>During the absence of the two, Jerningham
      directed Meg's attention to Meadows: "This is the
      man shall abide here for a time; I must send t'other
      on business that bears no delay,&#8212;him that lies up-stairs,
      I mean. 'Tis partly for that reason I have
      come here. And partly 'tis that I may, for an hour
      or so, play the host to a visitor that must perforce
      lodge here to-night,&#8212;a young woman."</p>
    <p>He paused; but Meg merely paid attention to
      him with eyes and ears, and displayed no emotion.</p>
    <p>"She is daughter to a merchant I much esteem
      in London; she has been in some manner bewitched,
      or constrained, or seduced, to fly from her home
      to this neighbourhood with an unthrift knave. By
      chance the plot came to my ears, and for her father's
      sake, and her honour's, I have caused her to be stayed
      in her flight and fetched hither. To-morrow I will
      come and put her aboard a vessel that shall carry
      her to Tilbury, where her father hath gone upon his
      affairs. If it fall to you to comfort or serve her
      while she is here, take heed you talk nothing of
      the matter, for all she may say to you. And not
      a word of this before Captain Ravenshaw when
      he comes down."</p>
    <p>Whatever were Meg's thoughts, she kept them
      to herself. Though she might fear ghosts and
      witches, she was not to be thrown out of composure
      by surprises and visits, even if they came<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_294"
          name="Page_294">[294]</a></span>
      thick in a few hours, after months of the still
      and solitary life that was the rule at the Grange.</p>
    <p>Goodcole and Jeremy returned, the former carrying
      the rapier and dagger with a nonchalant, even
      contemptuous, air, as if his task had been too easy.
      Jerningham smiled approval; he took the weapons,
      thrust the dagger in his girdle, and laid the rapier
      behind him on the table, as his own scabbard was, of
      course, occupied. He then sent Jeremy back with a
      candle to summon the captain down to the hall.</p>
    <p>When the captain came, it was he that held
      the candle; while with one hand he dragged Jeremy
      by the collar.</p>
    <p>"Hell and furies!" he roared; "what nest of
      rogues, what den of thieves, what&#8212;what&#8212;" He
      paused, and stared open-mouthed at Jerningham,
      who was standing with folded arms and a look of
      amusement.</p>
    <p>"How now, captain? What is ill with you?"</p>
    <p>"My weapons, sir&#8212;my rapier, my dagger&#8212;angled,
      filched, stolen in my sleep! God's death,
      is this the kind of a house you keep here?&#8212;Ah,
      you have them, I see."</p>
    <p>But Jerningham pleasantly raised his hand, so
      that the captain in mere courtesy stopped in the
      midst of a stride forward, and waited for the
      other's words.</p>
    <p>"A slight piece of mirth, captain, and a lesson<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_295"
          name="Page_295">[295]</a></span>
      for you, too. Coming hither upon a sudden business,
      and learning you were so sound a sleeper,
      I saw my chance of disarming you, and showing
      you what danger a man may be in asleep."</p>
    <p>"Why, sooth, I am not wont to sleep so sound,"
      said Ravenshaw, a little shamefacedly; "but, being
      come to this quiet and lone place, I allowed myself
      to slide, as one might say, and&#8212;so 'twas. But
      to take my weapons from me awake, that were
      a different business, sir, I think I may say."</p>
    <p>"All the world knows that, captain."</p>
    <p>"By your leave, sir, I'll have them back again,
      I feel awkward without 'em."</p>
    <p>"A mere moment, I pray you, captain," said Jerningham,
      with a smile of harmless raillery. "I
      would have you hear first the business I have
      come hither so late to send you upon. As it is
      so sudden a matter, and hath some discomfort in
      it, you might take it in choler; and then 'twere best
      you had no steel to your hand."</p>
    <p>Ravenshaw thought that his master's wit was
      of a very childish quality; but said, merely, as he
      summoned patience:</p>
    <p>"What is the business?"</p>
    <p>"Oh, a slight, simple matter in itself, but needing
      absolute sureness in the doing, and instant speed
      in the starting. This letter is to be carried to
      Dover, to him that is named upon it, and an<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_296"
          name="Page_296">[296]</a></span>
      answer brought to me at Winchester House. That
      is all."</p>
    <p>"Oh, pish! a slight, paltry journey; nothing to
      make me choleric. With the horse I rode to-day,
      I'll go and come in four days."</p>
    <p>Which was very good time upon the horses and
      roads of that period.</p>
    <p>"But there's the pinch," quoth Jerningham, "I
      must have the answer Monday morning ere the
      Exchange opens. You must know I take a gentleman's
      part in a merchant's venture or so, and if
      certain cargoes now due at Dover&#8212;In short,
      you must ride forth immediately, as soon as horse
      can be saddled."</p>
    <p>Ravenshaw, remembering his promise to pay Cutting
      Tom at the parson's on the morrow noon,
      slowly shook his head.</p>
    <p>"How now, captain? Would you shirk at the
      outset? Will you be continually failing me? This
      is no such matter as the other, man."</p>
    <p>"I do not shirk; but I will not start to-night. I
      will set forth to-morrow, and make what speed man
      and beast can."</p>
    <p>"Look you, captain; my commands are that you
      set forth now. If you choose to throw yourself out
      upon the world again&#8212;"</p>
    <p>Jerningham paused. Now, in truth, Ravenshaw
      had felt he could be very comfortable for a time<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_297"
          name="Page_297">[297]</a></span>
      on this quiet estate; his body and his wits, both
      somewhat overtaxed in the struggle for existence
      he had so long maintained, plead for repose. He
      sighed, and fell back upon obvious objections, not
      aware that Jerningham already knew of his engagement
      for the morrow with Cutting Tom.</p>
    <p>"Why, bethink you, the darkness&#8212;" he blundered.</p>
    <p>"A man may go a steady pace by lantern-light.
      I've ridden many a mile so," said Jerningham.</p>
    <p>"But how is a man to keep the right road, with
      none awake to tell him?"</p>
    <p>"You must know the way to the highroad,
      for you came over it to-day; and you must know
      the highroad as far as to Canterbury, for you told
      me so when I directed you to this place. It will be
      daylight long before you come to Canterbury."</p>
    <p>The captain shook his head again.</p>
    <p>Jerningham felt that time was passing rapidly.
      "If you are for disobedience, you are no longer
      for my service," he said. "Take yourself from
      my house and my land forthwith."</p>
    <p>Ravenshaw laughed; and stood motionless, which
      was what Jerningham wished, in case the captain
      was determined against an immediate start for
      Dover, for it would not do to have him free in the
      neighbourhood, perchance to learn of the treachery
      concerning the maid in time to give trouble. It had<span class="pagenum"><a
          id="Page_298" name="Page_298">[298]</a></span>
      occurred to Jerningham that a threatening step on
      the captain's part, by affording excuse for a deed of
      blood, would lessen its horror and create in Meg,
      with less fear of retribution upon the house, less
      mood for turning accuser. So he resumed, with
      studied offensiveness of tone:</p>
    <p>"Begone from my house, I bid you!" With
      which, he drew the captain's dagger as if he forgot it
      was not his own.</p>
    <p>Jerningham's back was to the table; Ravenshaw
      faced him, three or four paces away; by the front
      door stood Meadows, with a long knife in his girdle;
      Goodcole, before the fireplace, was similarly armed.
      Meg and Jeremy, wondering spectators, were near
      the kitchen door. Ravenshaw noted all this in a
      single glance right and left; noted in the looks of
      the two men the habit of instant readiness to support
      their master.</p>
    <p>"Pray, consider the hour," said Ravenshaw, feeling
      it was a time for temporising.</p>
    <p>"'Tis for you to consider; I command," said
      Jerningham, taking the captain's sword from the
      table behind him.</p>
    <p>"You should give me my weapons before you bid
      me depart," said the captain, in as light a tone as he
      could assume.</p>
    <p>"When you are gone, I will throw them after
      you."</p>
    <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_299" id="Page_299">[299]</a></span></p>
    <p>Ravenshaw dashed forward with a growl; but
      stopped short in time, with the point of his own
      sword at his breast. He had an impulse to grasp the
      blade; but he knew, if he were quick enough for
      that, there was yet the dagger to be reckoned with,
      besides the two men, who drew their knives at that
      moment. Jerningham seemed to brace himself for a
      spring; he held the captain's sword and dagger as in
      sockets of iron; a dark gleam shone in his eyes.
      Ravenshaw knew the look; time and again he had
      worn it himself; he knew also when, as player in a
      game, he was within a move of being checkmated.</p>
    <p>"Well," quoth he, with a grin of resignation,
      "you hold all the good cards. I will carry your
      letter." He suddenly bethought him of a friend or
      two in Rochester, which he would pass through early
      in the morning if he made the journey, by whom he
      might send Cutting Tom's money to the parson.
      Contemplating the life of ease he had promised himself
      in his new service, he was not sorry a good
      pretext had occurred for withdrawing his refusal.</p>
    <p>"You will set out immediately?" asked Jerningham.</p>
    <p>"The sooner the better, now."</p>
    <p>Jerningham sent the old man out with a lantern to
      saddle the captain's horse and bring it to the door.
      He then handed the letter to the captain, and gave
      particular instructions, such as would be necessary in<span class="pagenum"><a
          id="Page_300" name="Page_300">[300]</a></span>
      a genuine errand. Jeremy reappeared, at the front
      door, and announced that the horse was ready. Jerningham
      surrendered the captain's rapier and dagger
      with grace, and gave him money for the journey.
      Ravenshaw then examined the lantern which Jeremy
      brought him, waved a farewell to Jerningham and
      Meg, and strode to the door.</p>
    <p>Jerningham breathed softly, lest even a sigh of
      satisfaction might betray his sense of triumph. "She
      is mine!" sang his heart.</p>
    <p>The door, left slightly ajar by the old man, opened
      wide as if by a will of its own, just as the captain
      was about to grasp it. A white-bearded, ruddy-faced
      man, dressed in rags and upheld by one leg and a
      crutch, stood grinning at the threshold.</p>
    <p>"God save your worship!" said he to the captain.
      "We come late; but first our affairs hindered us,
      and then we mistook the way. By good chance, we
      find you awake; else had we passed the night under
      some penthouse or such, hereabouts, and come to
      drink your health in the morning."</p>
    <p>Ravenshaw having mechanically stepped back, the
      old beggar hobbled in, followed by several other
      maimed ragamuffins, with whom came the two
      women Ravenshaw had seen in the afternoon, and
      a pair of handsome frowsy young hussies who had
      not appeared in the road. The legless dwarf still
      rode upon a comrade's shoulders. As the motley<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_301"
          name="Page_301">[301]</a></span>
      gang trooped in, there was a great clatter and thud
      of crutches, wooden legs, and staves.</p>
    <p>"God's death! who are these?" cried Jerningham,
      in petulant astonishment.</p>
    <p>"Some poor friends of mine I met on the way
      hither," said Ravenshaw, apologetically. "I asked
      them to sup with me here. I had well-nigh forgot."</p>
    <p>"Sup with you! By what right&#8212;well, no matter
      for that. Where did you think to find provender for
      all those mouths?"</p>
    <p>"I was to find drink only; they were to find
      meat."</p>
    <p>"Ay," said the chief beggar, "chickens; and here
      they be, young and plump." He thrust his hand
      into a sack another fellow carried, and drew out a
      cold roast pullet. The captain gazed at this specimen
      with admiring eyes, and unconsciously licked
      his lips.</p>
    <p>"By your leave," said he to Jerningham, "I'll
      tarry but a half-hour to play the host to my invited
      guests; and then away. I can make up the time; a
      half-hour, more or less&#8212;"</p>
    <p>"'Tis not to be thought of!" cried Jerningham.
      "There has been too much time lost already."</p>
    <p>"Nay, I'll make it up, I tell you. I am bound to
      these people by my invitation; they have come far
      out of their way."</p>
    <p>"Oh, as for that, they need not go away thirsty.<span class="pagenum"><a
          id="Page_302" name="Page_302">[302]</a></span>
      Jeremy, take these&#8212;good people&#8212;to the kitchen,
      and broach a cask." Master Jerningham, in his
      desire for Ravenshaw's departure, could force himself
      to any concession; he considered that, left to
      themselves, these beggars would be no obstacle to
      his design; they could be kept at their ale in the
      kitchen.</p>
    <p>"Why, to tell the truth," interposed the captain,
      "'tis not so much their thirst troubles me; 'tis my
      hunger." And he leaned a little toward the fowl,
      sniffing, and feasting on it with his eyes.</p>
    <p>"Take it with you, man, and eat as you ride," said
      Jerningham, still restraining his impatience.</p>
    <p>"Why, that's fair enough," replied Ravenshaw.
      "I'll just drink one cup with these my guests, and
      then leave 'em to your hospitality." Without more
      ado, he walked to the kitchen door, where Jeremy
      was standing, and motioned the beggars to follow.
      They filed into the kitchen, seven men and four
      women, not a whole body in the gang save the two
      robust wenches.</p>
    <p>"A bare minute or so, sir," said Ravenshaw to
      Jerningham, and went after them, taking the lantern
      with him. Soon there came from the kitchen the
      noise of loosened tongues chattering in the gibberish
      of the mendicant profession.
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_303" id="Page_303">[303]</a></span></p>

         <p class="center"> "THERE ... WAS THE MAID OF CHEAPSIDE, PALE AND <br />
         BEWILDERED."</p>
      </div>

    <p>Master Jerningham, knowing that opposition would
      only cause further delay, controlled himself as best
      he could, and waited
      in silence, pacing the hall, while
      the captain had his humour. Meg, with housewifely
      instinct, betook herself to the kitchen to keep an
      eye on matters there. Presently the captain reappeared,
      with a pullet in one hand, his lantern in the
      other, Meg having meanwhile lighted candles in the
      kitchen.</p>
    <p>"And now to horse!" cried he, closing the
      kitchen door after him.</p>
    <p>"And God save us from any more delays!" said
      Jerningham, with a pretence of jocularity.</p>
    <p>"So say I," quoth Ravenshaw, stalking forward.</p>
    <p>In the centre of the hall he stopped, with a cry of
      astonishment, which made Jerningham turn swiftly
      toward the open front door.</p>
    <p>There in the porch, which was suddenly lighted
      up with rays of torch and lantern, was the maid
      of Cheapside, pale and bewildered, held on either
      side by Cutting Tom and one of his comrades.</p>

    <h2><a id="CHAPTER_XIX" name="CHAPTER_XIX">CHAPTER XIX.</a></h2>
    <p>KNAVE AGAINST GENTLEMAN.</p>
    <p>
      <span style="margin-left: 3em;">"Who shall take your word?</span><br />
      A whoreson, upstart, apocryphal captain,<br />
      Whom not a Puritan in Blackfriars will trust<br />
      So much as for a feather."<br />
      <br />
      &#8212;<i>The Alchemist.</i><br />
    </p>
    <p>Cutting Tom was struck motionless at sight of
      the captain; but, after a moment, reassuring himself
      by a look at Jerningham, he led his captive into the
      hall. His men followed. The group came to a halt
      ere any one found voice.</p>
    <p>Ravenshaw, recovering a little from his surprise,
      was about to hurl a question at Cutting Tom, when
      his tongue was stayed by his seeing the maid's eyes
      turn with blazing indignation upon himself, and her
      lips open to speak.</p>
    <p>"So, then, it is your work!" she said.</p>
    <p>"My work?" quoth the captain, in a maze, dropping
      his chicken.</p>
    <p>"No doubt you spied upon poor Master Holyday,
      and corrupted these rogues he trusted in," she went
      on; and then, giving way, she wept: "Oh, God! into
      whose hands have I fallen!"</p>
    <p>Ravenshaw quailed at her tears; but suddenly<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_305"
          name="Page_305">[305]</a></span>
      stiffened himself, set down his lantern, and said
      wrathfully to Cutting Tom:</p>
    <p>"What means this, knave? Why came you here?
      Where is&#8212;the gentleman you serve? Speak, thou
      slave, or by&#8212;"</p>
    <p>But Millicent, coming swiftly out of her tears,
      cried, scornfully:</p>
    <p>"Think not to blind me, thou villain! The gentleman
      is where you bade these wretches leave him,&#8212;in
      the woods, robbed,&#8212;mayhap slain! Alas,
      having seen his fate, what may I expect for myself!"
      And again she fell into lamentations.</p>
    <p>"I understand this not," said Ravenshaw. "Cutting
      Tom, thou blundering hound, why bring you
      this maid to this place, and to me?"</p>
    <p>"Oh, out upon pretense!" cried Millicent.
      "Thinkst thou I am so great a fool as not to see?
      God send I were Sir Peregrine's wife rather than
      such a villain's captive!"</p>
    <p>"Mistress, I know not why you are here, nor what
      hath befallen Master Holyday. There is some mistake
      or falseness, which I shall worm out of this
      tongue-tied knave; but first assure yourself you are
      not my captive."</p>
    <p>"Oh, peace! As if this fellow, whom you call by
      name, and who cringes before you, had not turned
      treacherous!"</p>
    <p>"Ten to one he hath turned treacherous, and dear<span class="pagenum"><a
          id="Page_306" name="Page_306">[306]</a></span>
      he shall pay for it; but he hath not turned so at my
      instigation."</p>
    <p>"Oh, no more, I pray. Even this fellow is not
      bold-faced enough to deny it is for you he has
      betrayed us. God knows what is to become of me,
      a prisoner in your hands, without a soul that knows
      my whereabouts to protect me!"</p>
    <p>At this, Master Jerningham, who had kept still
      while an inspiration perfected itself in his mind,
      stepped courteously forward, and said, with grave
      sympathy:</p>
    <p>"Not so, mistress. I, the master of this house,
      will protect you in it."</p>
    <p>She looked at him in surprise. His was a face she
      recalled vaguely as having seen, or faces more or
      less resembling it, in the streets of London, or in
      churches, or other public places; but it was not a
      face she had ever had reason to note carefully.
      Whatever were the forgotten occasions upon which
      she may have observed it, as she had observed ten
      thousand faces worth a careless second glance, the
      night of her adventure in February was not one of
      them; for on that night, besides keeping himself
      in shadow, and leaving all talk to Sir Clement
      Ermsby, Jerningham had hidden his countenance
      under the brim of a great Spanish hat. So his face
      at this moment, appearing as that of a stranger,
      awakened in her mind no association either pleasant<span class="pagenum"><a
          id="Page_307" name="Page_307">[307]</a></span>
      or unpleasant; in itself, it wore so serious and sweet
      a smile, and the manner of its owner was so quietly
      chivalrous, that Millicent's feelings promptly declared
      in its favour. A sudden sense of safety came over
      her, depriving her for a moment of speech. Then
      she murmured, unsteadily:</p>
    <p>"Master of this house, say you?"</p>
    <p>"Ay, mistress, but no conspirator in your being
      brought here. I am not often at the place; this
      man hath newly arrived as steward; I came to-night
      without warning, no more expecting to see strangers
      in my house than he expected to see me. I know
      not what hath been afoot; but Heaven must have
      sent me here, if my coming has saved you from
      a mischief."</p>
    <p>He offered her his hand. Cutting Tom had
      already released her arm. After a moment, she
      took the hand, and allowed Jerningham to lead
      her to a seat by the table. As she scanned his
      features, an increasing trustfulness appeared in her
      own.</p>
    <p>"Sir," she faltered, deeply relieved and grateful,
      "I must thank Heaven for my deliverance. To
      find a gentleman&#8212;after these rascals&#8212;"</p>
    <p>She cast a glance at Ravenshaw, and trembled
      to think what manner of man she had escaped;
      for indeed at that instant the captain looked like
      the very devil.</p>
    <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_308" id="Page_308">[308]</a></span></p>
    <p>"He deliver you!" exclaimed Ravenshaw, as
      soon as his feelings permitted him to speak calmly.
      "Why, he is of all men the one you most need
      deliverance from!"</p>
    <p>Jerningham smiled with tolerant contempt. "I
      scarce think you will believe that, mistress," said
      he, lightly, "seeing how completely I am a stranger
      to you."</p>
    <p>"Believe him?" she replied, scornfully. "He is
      the prince of cozeners; he is all made of lies and
      shifts. I know not how he hath come to be steward
      to a gentleman; belike you know not of him; perchance
      he hath passed upon you by another name,
      as he did upon us; he is Captain Ravenshaw."</p>
    <p>"To say truth, mistress, I knew him; but I little
      thought&#8212;"</p>
    <p>"Knew me?" said Ravenshaw, with a laugh.
      "Ay, indeed. Well enough for me in turn to know
      his designs against yourself, mistress; from which,
      as from marriage with that old dotard, I had hoped
      to see you saved. As for your being brought here,
      ask these men. Find your tongue, Cutting Tom,
      and explain this."</p>
    <p>"Why, of a truth," said Cutting Tom, slowly,
      finding courage in a significant glance from Jerningham,
      "I know not what you would have me explain.
      I am but a dull-witted man; if you had only told
      me beforehand what to say&#8212;"</p>
    <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_309" id="Page_309">[309]</a></span></p>
    <p>"'Tis too clear these knaves acted by your orders,
      captain," interrupted Jerningham.</p>
    <p>"Why, yes, so we did, and that's the hell of it,"
      said Cutting Tom.</p>
    <p>"Liar and slave!" cried Ravenshaw, half drawing
      his sword; but he controlled himself, and said:
      "'Tis plain that you, Master Jerningham, have
      bought this knave, though 'tis beyond my ken how
      you learned what he was to be about to-night.
      Mistress, I swear to you, the man who intends
      you harm is he that you put your trust in; the
      man who would save you is he that you revile
      and disbelieve."</p>
    <p>"Mistress," said Jerningham, ignoring this speech,
      "wherever you have come from, wherever you would
      go, 'tis now too late in the night to leave this house.
      Shall I conduct you to a chamber where you will be
      safe and alone? Your ears need not then be assailed
      by the rude talk of this man. Surely you will not
      doubt me upon his wild words?"</p>
    <p>"Nay," said she, rising compliantly, "I heed not
      his words."</p>
    <p>"For proof of them," said the captain, "let me
      tell you that this gentleman employed me to be his
      go-between with you."</p>
    <p>She blushed. Jerningham said: "Oh, villain!
      You have the devil's invention, I think. You would
      make yourself out a worse knave, that you might<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_310"
          name="Page_310">[310]</a></span>
      make her distrust me. Mistress, if you have the
      smallest fear&#8212;"</p>
    <p>"Sir, God forbid I should doubt a gentleman on
      the word of a known rascal!"</p>
    <p>Jerningham led her by the hand toward the corridor
      at the right. But the captain, not delayed by
      his momentary reflection upon the occasional inconvenience
      of a bad reputation, sprang ahead of them,
      and took his place at the corridor entrance, grasping
      his sword. Master Jerningham instantly drew back
      with the maid, in a manner implying that the captain's
      threatening action was as much directed against
      her as him. He hastened with her toward the opposite
      passage, but Ravenshaw was again beforehand.
      Jerningham thereupon conducted her to the front
      part of the hall. It was not his desire to release
      her hand, as he must needs do if he himself fought
      Ravenshaw at this juncture. He did not wish to
      call in Ermsby yet, fearing the effect her recognition
      of that gallant might have upon her confidence in
      himself. His own two followers in the hall were
      armed only with knives. Cutting Tom, the disguised
      Gregory, and their three companions, were
      his men in reality; but he must seemingly win them
      over before using them, lest she perceive they indeed
      acted for him in giving this direful turn to her elopement.</p>
    <p>"Thou whom he calls Cutting Tom," said Jer<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_311"
          name="Page_311">[311]</a></span>ningham,
      "thou and thy fellows,&#8212;ye have done a
      dangerous thing for your necks in conveying this
      lady hither against her will."</p>
    <p>"Sir, I know it," replied Tom. "But I was led
      by my needs, and these my followers knew nothing
      of the business. I take you to be a gentleman that
      has power in the world. I beg of you, now that the
      villainy has failed, deal not too hardly with us."</p>
    <p>"It lies with yourselves. If you be minded to
      undo the villainy, to serve me in my protection of
      this maid&#8212;"</p>
    <p>"We will, we will! and thank your good worship!"
      said Tom, quickly, and turned to his men
      with a look which elicited from them a chorus of
      confirmatory "ayes," supported by a variety of oaths.</p>
    <p>"Then seize that man, till I pass with this lady,"
      said Jerningham, in a decided tone. "To him, all
      of ye,&#8212;Meadows and Goodcole, too!"</p>
    <p>Cutting Tom and his men drew their swords;
      having first attached their lanterns and torch to
      wall-sconces, and dropped the bundle of Holyday's
      clothes. The party advanced upon Ravenshaw, being
      joined by Meadows and Goodcole, which twain
      preferred wisely that the bearers of longer weapons
      should precede them into the captain's immediate
      neighbourhood. Tom himself went rather shufflingly,
      doubtless willing to give opportunity for any
      more impetuous comrade to be more forward in the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_312"
          name="Page_312">[312]</a></span>
      matter. But the other men were no more eager
      than he to be first; and so the movement, beginning
      with some show of a fearless rush, deteriorated in
      a trice to a hesitating shamble. At two steps from
      the captain, the party came to a stop.</p>
    <p>"Ho, dogs, will ye come dancing up to me so
      gaily?" cried Ravenshaw. "Dance back again as
      fast!" His rapier leaped out, and sang against
      three of their own blades in the time of a breath.</p>
    <p>All seven of the men, appalled at his sudden onslaught,
      stepped hastily back. The captain strode
      forward. The fellows increased their backward pace.
      He followed. They turned in a kind of panic, and
      ran pell-mell for the front door. Laughing loudly
      at their retreat, Ravenshaw stopped, as he was in no
      mind to be drawn outside while Millicent remained
      within. At sound of his laugh, the fellows turned
      and stood about the doorway with their weapons in
      defence.</p>
    <p>"Sir," said Ravenshaw, turning to Master Jerningham,
      "I pray you, look upon this maid; consider
      her youth and her innocence. Will you mar such
      an one a lifetime, to pleasure yourself an hour? As
      you are a gentleman, I ask you, give her up."</p>
    <p>"Do not give me up to him!" she said, affrightedly,
      clinging closer to Jerningham.</p>
    <p>Ravenshaw shook his head in sorrow. "Ah,
      mistress, that you should think I would harm you!<span class="pagenum"><a
          id="Page_313" name="Page_313">[313]</a></span>
      If you but knew&#8212;but for what you think of me,
      no matter. 'Tis a cruel twist of circumstance that
      you should oppose him that would save you, and
      cleave to him that would destroy you. You would
      know how the affair stands, if there were a spark
      of truth to be found among these knaves and
      traitors. Oh, for a gleam of honesty! How foul
      falsehood looks when it has the whole place to
      itself!"</p>
    <p>A whinny of impatience was heard from the horse
      waiting outside.</p>
    <p>"'Tis high time you were in the saddle, captain,"
      said Jerningham. "Come, man; I will forget your
      attempt upon this maid, since no harm has followed.
      And she, too, will forget it, if she take my counsel.
      Will you trust your welfare in this matter to me,
      mistress?"</p>
    <p>"Entirely," answered Millicent, in a low voice.</p>
    <p>"Oh, mistress, how you are deceived!" said
      Ravenshaw. "What can I do to save you?"</p>
    <p>She shrank back from his look.</p>
    <p>"Fear not, mistress," said Jerningham, softly.
      "Come, come, captain, an end, an end! Time is
      hastening. I pray you, be off upon your ride to
      Dover."</p>
    <p>"Dover!" echoed the captain, with a strange
      laugh. "Ride to Dover! By God's death, things
      have changed in the past ten minutes! I shall not
          <span class="pagenum">
          <a id="Page_314" name="Page_314">[314]</a>
          </span>
      ride to Dover, thank your worship! not this night!
      I shall stay here to save this lady in spite of herself!&#8212;in
      spite of herself and of you all, good gentlemen!"</p>
    <p>"Is this your promise, you rascal?" exclaimed
      Jerningham. "You gave your word to ride forthwith."</p>
    <p>"And being a rascal, I claim a rascal's privilege to
      break his word!" cried Ravenshaw. "Away from
      that lady, or by this hand&#8212;"</p>
    <p>He did not finish his threat, but made straightway
      for Jerningham. The latter ran with the maid to
      the farther side of the table, and whipped out his
      sword. Ravenshaw, in pursuing, turned his back to
      the fellows at the doorway. "Upon him, men!"
      shouted Jerningham, and then, raising his voice still
      higher, called out: "Ho, Ermsby, to the rescue!"</p>
    <p>Ravenshaw, trusting his ears to warn him of what
      threatened in the rear, kept Jerningham's sword in
      play rather cautiously, for fear of too much endangering
      or frightening Millicent, who was pale as death.
      The girl, clinging to Jerningham, was thus rather a
      protection than an encumbrance to that gentleman.
      Very soon the captain heard the bustle of newcomers
      entering at the front door, and then a general movement,
      led by a more resolute tread than he had
      noticed before. He turned and faced Sir Clement
      Ermsby, whom he recognised but vaguely as a per<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_315"
          name="Page_315">[315]</a></span>son
      with whom he had been in collision sometime
      in the past. He parried the knight's thrust, and
      guarded himself with his dagger from a lunge of
      Cutting Tom's. He then spun around on his heel,
      lest Jerningham might either pierce his back, or
      profit by the opportunity to take the maid away.</p>
    <p>Jerningham had chosen the latter course, but he
      was hindered by the rush of some of his own men,
      who had run around the table in order that the
      captain might be surrounded. Thus checked for an
      instant, and in some way made sensible of Ravenshaw's
      last movement, Jerningham turned back, and
      again engaged the captain. Ravenshaw was thus
      between two forces, one headed by Jerningham, the
      other by Sir Clement. He leaped upon the table,
      jumped to the floor on the other side, while half a
      dozen blades darted after him; dragged the table to
      a corner, and turned to face his enemies from the
      little triangular space behind it. Led by Ermsby,
      they rushed upon him, thinking to find the table of
      short use as a bulwark against such numbers.</p>
    <p>But Jerningham stood back out of the rush, still
      holding Millicent by the hand, and shouted:</p>
    <p>"Some keep him busy above the table; some
      thrust under at his legs. Let the knave die, 'tis
      good time! I'll look to the comfort of the lady."
      And he started again toward the right-hand passage.</p>
    <p>Ravenshaw bent forward across the table, and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_316"
          name="Page_316">[316]</a></span>
      swept aside the points of steel with sword and dagger;
      but they threatened him anew, and he heard
      men scrambling under the table to stab his legs; he
      saw, between two heads of his foes, Jerningham's
      movement toward the passage, and he shouted:</p>
    <p>"Ho, rufflers, maunderers, upright men! a rescue!
      a rescue!"</p>
    <p>Jerningham halted, somewhat wondering. The
      kitchen door flew open, and, with a hasty thumping
      of crutches, the beggars hobbled in, men and women,
      most of them with pewter cans, from which they had
      been regaling themselves. At sight of these maimed
      creatures, with their frowsy hair, their gaunt looks,
      the red blotches and bandages of some, the white
      eyeballs of others, Millicent started back in horror.
      As the door by which they came in was near the
      passage toward which Jerningham was leading her,
      and as they spread into a wide group in entering,
      they blocked the way of her departure.</p>
    <p>"Stop the gentry cove!" cried Ravenshaw. "In
      the name of the salamon, stand by a brother!"</p>
    <p>The captain's assailants had drawn away a little to
      see who the newcomers were. Having satisfied himself
      at a glance, Sir Clement Ermsby laughed, and
      said: "A rescue, sooth! A bunch of refuse,&#8212;rotten
      pieces of men. Come, back to your work!"
      And he renewed the attack on Ravenshaw; while
      Jerningham, calling out, "Ay, to him! these be<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_317"
          name="Page_317">[317]</a></span>
      helpless cripples," started again for the passage, his
      sword-point forward.</p>
    <p>But with a wild whoop the beggars straightened
      out of their lame attitudes, swung their crutches and
      staves in the air, lost all regard of sores and patches,
      found arms for empty sleeves, showed keen eyes
      where white balls had plead for pity, threw off all the
      shams of their profession, and swept upon the captain's
      foes. A sturdy blow of a staff bore down
      Jerningham's rapier, a filching hook tore his dagger
      from his other hand. Iron-shod crutches and staves
      rained upon the heads of Sir Clement and the other
      men; hooks caught their clothing, and dragged some
      to the floor. When at close quarters, the beggars
      drew their knives; the women fought like men.
      Millicent, separated from Jerningham in the fray, ran
      shrieking in the one direction open to her; this was
      toward the corner at the right of the front door.
      Ravenshaw, dashing through the confusion, placed
      himself triumphantly at her side. She essayed to
      run from him; but he gently swept her with a
      powerful arm into the corner behind him.</p>
    <p>"Oh, God, I am lost!" she cried, seeing Jerningham
      and his men brought to pause by the sturdy
      wielders of staff, crutch, and knife.</p>
    <p>Across the captain's mind flashed a wild project of
      bearing her away in search of her uncle's house,
      which he knew was somewhere in the neighbour<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_318"
          name="Page_318">[318]</a></span>hood;
      but he heard a sudden fierce dash of the long-expected
      rain against the rear windows, saw how faint
      and exhausted she was, thought of the opposition
      she would offer, and considered the up-hill fight he
      would have to wage against an enemy desperate with
      the fear of losing his prey. He had a better idea,&#8212;one
      in which prowess might be supplemented with
      craft.</p>
    <p>Quite near him, in the wall at his right hand, was
      the open door to the porter's room which he had
      noticed upon arriving at the house; it had no other
      means of entrance or exit, its high-placed window
      being a mere slit. He purposely moved a little to the
      left. Millicent, seeing an opening, glided along the
      wall to escape him. He sprang forward, and confronted
      her just at the door of the porter's room.
      Recoiling from him, she instinctively darted through
      the door. "Good!" cried the captain, taking his
      place in the doorway, his face to the hall.</p>
    <p>Millicent, in the little room, sank upon a pallet,
      which was its only furniture, and put out her hands
      to keep the captain from approaching her. But she
      saw that he had stopped at the threshold, with his
      back to her. It was, indeed, no part of his plan to
      follow her into the room.</p>
    <p>Jerningham, startled at the maid's sudden disappearance,
      ran forward with a cry of rage; but Ravenshaw
      met sword and dagger with sword and dagger,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_319"
          name="Page_319">[319]</a></span>
      and Jerningham was fain to draw back to save his
      body. Matters thereupon resumed a state of abeyance,
      during which men recovered breath, regained
      their feet, and took account of bleeding heads and
      flesh wounds.</p>
    <p>"Hark you!" spoke the captain, in a tone meant
      for her as well as for Jerningham. "It is now for us
      to prove which of us means this lady no harm. Let
      her abide where she is, till the storm and the night
      are past; then, together, we'll conduct her to her
      friends. And meanwhile, the man who attempts to
      enter this room declares himself her enemy."</p>
    <p>Jerningham's face showed the rage of temporary
      defeat. "Then come from the door there," he said,
      sullenly, for want of a better speech.</p>
    <p>"Nay, for this night I am the door here,&#8212;though
      she may close this wooden door an she please.
      These"&#8212;his sword and dagger&#8212;"she'll find true
      bolts and bars. She may e'en sleep, if she will,&#8212;there's
      a pallet to lie on."</p>
    <p>Sitting weak and perplexed on the pallet in the
      dark little apartment, she wondered what purpose the
      captain might be about.</p>
    <p>At the suggestion of sleep, Jerningham had an
      idea. Pretending to confer in whispers with Sir
      Clement, he secretly beckoned Gregory, who was
      still in his false beard. The servant approaching
      without appearance of intent, Jerningham, still under<span class="pagenum"><a
          id="Page_320" name="Page_320">[320]</a></span>
      cover of talking to Ermsby, asked in undertone for
      the sleeping potion which Gregory was to have
      obtained. The lackey transferred a phial in an unperceived
      manner to his master's hand. Pocketing
      it in triumph, Jerningham turned to the captain:</p>
    <p>"We shall see how honestly you mean, then.
      And that the lady may rest freer of annoyance, send
      these knaves of yours out of her hearing, back to
      their ale."</p>
    <p>"With all my heart&#8212;when you send away your
      knaves also."</p>
    <p>"I will do so; but fear not, mistress," he called
      out. "I will not leave this hall. 'Tis all for the
      avoiding of bloodshed, and your better comfort in
      the end."</p>
    <p>"'Tis well, sir; I am not afraid," she answered, in
      a tired, trembling voice.</p>
    <p>It was agreed that Jerningham's men should go
      into the room on the left-hand side of the hall, diagonally
      opposite that in which the maid was; that the
      beggars should return to the kitchen; that the signal
      for both parties to withdraw should be given by
      Jerningham. He was about to speak the word forthwith,
      when the captain interposed:</p>
    <p>"By your leave, I'll first have private speech with
      my friends. You have already had with yours, and
      may have again ere they depart."</p>
    <p>Jerningham saw no way of refusing, or, indeed,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_321"
          name="Page_321">[321]</a></span>
      much reason therefor; doubtless the captain wished
      but to counsel his rascals to be vigilant for a possible
      second call. So Jerningham gave consent by silence.
      Ravenshaw had a conference with the beggars, in
      which chief parts were taken by the white-bearded
      rogue and the ancient cripple who had guided the
      maunderers to the Grange.</p>
    <p>Presently Ravenshaw signified that he had done;
      whereupon Jerningham said "Begone," and the two
      parties filed out, each narrowly watching the other,
      Jerningham's men taking a torch with them, the
      beggars clumping with their iron-tipped wooden implements.
      Only Ravenshaw took note that one of
      the lanterns disappeared with the beggars. The
      captain, Jerningham, Mistress Meg, who had watched
      recent occurrences from the kitchen door, and Sir
      Clement Ermsby were left in the hall.</p>
    <p>"How?" quoth the captain, staring at the knight.
      "Do you break faith? Why go you not with the
      other men?"</p>
    <p>"Troth, sir, I am nobody's man," replied Sir
      Clement. "I am this gentleman's friend, and, when
      I choose, I fight for him; but my comings and
      goings are not to be stipulated for by any man."</p>
    <p>Ravenshaw perceived that a minor point had been
      scored against him; but he was not much discomfited.
      He had merely to play for time, to guard the
      doorway of that room for an unknown number of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_322"
          name="Page_322">[322]</a></span>
      hours. As long as he could temporise, two antagonists
      were no worse than one; if it came to
      fighting, two were a little worse, but, as both must
      attack in front, the odds were nothing out of his
      experience.</p>
    <p>"Have we not met before this, sir?" asked Ravenshaw,
      scrutinising Ermsby.</p>
    <p>"My memory is but so-so," replied Sir Clement,
      quizzically.</p>
    <p>"Before God, I think we have," said the captain,
      "and upon opposite sides, too, as we are now. Would
      I could remember! I have had so many quarrels,
      so many foes. I could swear you and I had clashed
      once upon a time."</p>
    <p>Sir Clement, who remembered the meeting well
      enough, merely smiled as if amused at the captain's
      puzzlement. Ravenshaw drew a stool to the doorway,
      and sat down, weapons still in hand. Sir Clement
      was leaning back against the table, at the
      opposite side of the hall, with folded arms. He
      made mirth for himself by suggesting various impossible
      places where the captain might have met him;
      while Jerningham, ever keeping the corner of his eye
      on his enemy, went back and held a whispered conversation
      with Meg.</p>
    <p>"Fear not," said Jerningham, heeding the peremptory
      question in her eyes. "The maid is in yonder
      room. This captain, by a strange chance, knows her<span class="pagenum"><a
          id="Page_323" name="Page_323">[323]</a></span>
      as one he hath designs against. He would neither
      have her go free, nor taken back to her father. He
      thinks to find her at his mercy. But we shall outwit
      him, and no more fighting. 'Tis for you to&#8212;"</p>
    <p>"One would think he was her friend," said Meg,
      glancing toward the captain.</p>
    <p>"Poh! she fears him as he were the devil."</p>
    <p>"Does he, then, desire her?" queried Meg, with
      a curious feigned unconcernedness of tone and look.</p>
    <p>Jerningham regarded her with the silence of sudden
      discovery; then, restraining a smile, said, watchfully:
      "He is another's instrument, I think. Such a man's
      fancy would ne'er light upon a child; she is little
      more. A woman of your figure were more to his
      liking, I'll wager." He paused, to observe Meg's
      blush, which was not resentful; then he added, significantly:
      "If a woman were minded to make a
      fresh trial of life, with a brave husband now&#8212;"</p>
    <p>"Well, and what then?" said she, looking him
      frankly in the eyes. "How if a woman were? The
      man is not seeking a wife, ten to one."</p>
    <p>"A few drops of this, mixed with a man's wine,"
      said Jerningham, producing the phial in such manner
      that his body concealed it from Ravenshaw's view,
      "have been known to work a wonder."</p>
    <p>"What is it?" she whispered, gazing at it.</p>
    <p>"A love potion," he answered. "The surest in
      the world, too. 'Tis the one with which&#8212;" But<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_324"
          name="Page_324">[324]</a></span>
      he broke off, shook his head, and replaced the phial
      in his pocket.</p>
    <p>"Let me have it," she whispered, excitedly.</p>
    <p>"If you will swear to one thing."</p>
    <p>"What?"</p>
    <p>"That you will find means to use it this night."</p>
    <p>"Why this night?"</p>
    <p>He invented a reason. "So that, when it hath
      effect, you may use your power to draw him from
      that maid."</p>
    <p>"I swear," she replied. He passed the phial to
      her, directed her in detail what to do, and returned
      to the front of the hall as if from a mere conference
      upon household matters. Meg went back to the
      kitchen. She failed to notice there that one of
      the beggars, a very old man, was missing; or that
      the window-seat was wet, as if the casement had
      been recently opened and closed again. Nor could
      old Jeremy have called her attention to these
      matters, for upon their return the other beggars
      had so crowded around him at the ale-cask that he
      had seen and heard only them and their clamours.</p>
    <p>Ravenshaw and Sir Clement, having exhausted
      their topic of conversation, were regarding each
      other in silence. Jerningham, as his eyes fell upon
      the front door, suddenly exclaimed:</p>
    <p>"The horse! Zounds, in this pelting rain&#8212;"
      He seized one of the lanterns and ran to the porch.<span class="pagenum"><a
          id="Page_325" name="Page_325">[325]</a></span>
      "How now? The beast is not here!" He came
      back into the hall, looking puzzled.</p>
    <p>"Perhaps the old man hath put him under roof,"
      suggested Ermsby.</p>
    <p>Jerningham went to the kitchen door and called
      Jeremy, who averred he had not been near the horse
      since he had tied it outside the porch.</p>
    <p>"'Twas ill tied, no doubt," said Jerningham, "and
      hath got loose and sought shelter. Belike you left
      the stable door open. Go and see; and look in all
      the penthouses, too."</p>
    <p>Jeremy went out. His return was awaited in
      silence, Jerningham pacing the hall, Sir Clement
      staying motionless at the table's edge, Ravenshaw
      sitting upon the stool before Millicent's room. She
      had not closed the door; she remained upon the
      pallet, able to see a little of the hall, but herself out
      of the light that came in through the doorway. Her
      thoughts were in confusion; at last they became so
      clouded that, obeying the impulse of fatigue, she lay
      down on the pallet, without heed of the act; soon
      she was in a state between anxious waking and a
      troubled dream.</p>
    <p>Jeremy came back, dripping, and said the horse
      was not to be found.</p>
    <p>Berating him for stupidity, his master sent him
      back to the kitchen. Jerningham presently sat down
      upon a chair near the table against which Sir Clem<span class="pagenum"><a
          id="Page_326" name="Page_326">[326]</a></span>ent
      stood. Slowly the minutes passed, while the
      heavy beat of the rain against the casements was
      the only sound. Once Jerningham called out: "Is
      all well with you, mistress?"</p>
    <p>Millicent, brought to a sense of her whereabouts
      after a moment's bewilderment, answered: "Yes,
      I thank you." The silence fell again.</p>
    <p>At last Jerningham said to Sir Clement: "Those
      rascals yonder need not have all the good cheer
      to themselves. There's better drink than ale left
      in the house." He rose, and summoned Meg from
      the kitchen.</p>
    <p>"Fetch wine," said he. Meg, returning to the
      kitchen, presently reappeared therefrom with a
      flagon and a pewter drinking cup.</p>
    <p>"First fill a cup, I pray you," said Jerningham,
      "and carry it to the lady in yonder room."</p>
    <p>She poured out a cupful, set the flagon on the
      table, and approached the door at which Ravenshaw
      sat.</p>
    <p>"Nay, you shall not pass here," quoth the captain.</p>
    <p>"What, will you deny the unhappy lady that small
      comfort?" said Jerningham, while Meg paused.</p>
    <p>"No; I will convey it to her; but I'll first see
      you drink a cup of the same wine."</p>
    <p>Jerningham shrugged his shoulders, took the cup
      from Meg, drained it, and turned it upside down.
      He then refilled it. Meg carried it to the captain,<span class="pagenum"><a
          id="Page_327" name="Page_327">[327]</a></span>
      and held it close to his nostrils in handing it. He
      breathed its perfume, eyed it yearningly, then thrust
      his left hand with it into the room.</p>
    <p>"A cup of wine for you, mistress," called Jerningham.</p>
    <p>Millicent, again roused from half-slumber, was
      too gracious to refuse; she took the cup, sipped,
      and passed it back to the captain's waiting hand.
      He noticed that the cup was nearly full, but gave it
      back to Meg, though a little reluctantly. Jerningham
      emptied it down his own throat, and filled it for Sir
      Clement, who made one long grateful draught of the
      contents.</p>
    <p>"Fill for yourself, mistress," said Jerningham,
      affably. Meg shook her head, but, nevertheless,
      proceeded to pour out another cupful. Her back
      was toward Ravenshaw as she did so, but there was
      nothing in that to strike attention. What Jerningham
      and Sir Clement saw, however, was this: she
      held the cup with her thumb and little finger, against
      her palm, so that her three other fingers lay across
      the top. Along the inside of her middle finger was
      placed the phial, a narrow tube, tied to the finger
      with fine thread; the open end of the phial was
      toward the palm, which she had hitherto kept tight
      against it. But now, opening her fingers out above
      the rim of the cup as she poured the wine, she released
      a part of the phial's contents into the cup<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_328"
          name="Page_328">[328]</a></span>
      at the same time. The sleight required but a
      moment.</p>
    <p>She put down the flagon, transferred the cup to
      the other hand, and turned toward Ravenshaw.</p>
    <p>"Eh? What?" exclaimed Jerningham, in feigned
      disapproval, reaching out for the cup.</p>
    <p>"Nay," said Meg, holding it away from him;
      "hospitality ever, even to them you quarrel with!"</p>
    <p>Whereupon she walked gravely over to the captain
      and offered him the cup.</p>
    <p>Ravenshaw had thought he detected approbation
      of himself in this woman's looks at the time of his
      arrival; and now he thought he might flatter himself
      the approbation still existed. Attributing all to
      her good nature toward him, and not suspecting wine
      in the same vessel, and from the same flagon, as had
      supplied his enemies but a moment since, he grasped
      the cup with a hearty smile of gratitude, and emptied
      it swiftly down his throat.</p>
    <p>Meg received back the cup, placed it on the table
      beside the flagon, and passed silently to the kitchen,
      followed by a faint smile of mirth on the part of
      Jerningham. The smile was supplanted by a look
      of expectant curiosity as Jerningham turned his eyes
      upon Ravenshaw. The captain sat as before, rapier
      in one hand, dagger in the other. Jerningham himself
      had resumed his chair near the table, and Sir
      Clement retained his old attitude. In the little<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_329"
          name="Page_329">[329]</a></span>
      room, Millicent relapsed into a dreamy half-consciousness,
      wherein she seemed borne by rough
      winds through black and red clouds; the room
      appeared a vast space wherein this occurred; and
      yet always she was vaguely aware of her actual
      surroundings.</p>
    <p>Ravenshaw felt serenely comfortable; a delicious
      ease of mind and body came over him; the beat of
      the rain softened into a soothing lull; the hall grew
      dark before him. He opened his eyes with a start,
      amazed at himself for having let them close. A
      mist seemed to fill the place; through it appeared
      the faces of his two enemies, a curious smiling expression
      upon each.</p>
    <p>"What is it?" cried the captain, sharply, and
      gave his head a shake to throw off the drowsiness
      that invaded him.</p>
    <p>Jerningham's eyes shone with elation.</p>
    <p>"God's death, the wine!" cried Ravenshaw, staggering
      madly to his feet. "Methought there was
      an aftertaste. Ye've played foul with me!"</p>
    <p>He put his arms against the wall to keep himself
      from falling; his head swayed, and sank forward;
      the floor seemed to yield beneath him; darkness
      surged in upon him, and for an instant he knew not
      where he was or what he was about. But he flung
      himself back to life with a fierce effort, and began
      walking vigorously back and forth in front of his<span class="pagenum"><a
          id="Page_330" name="Page_330">[330]</a></span>
      doorway. He knew that his sole hope of resisting
      the drug, if it was what he guessed, lay in constant
      action of body and mind.</p>
    <p>Jerningham sat still; he had but to wait till the
      captain succumbed, delude Meg with the tale that
      the philtre sometimes began its operation by inducing
      a long sleep, find means to administer the rest of
      the potion to Millicent, and carry out his original
      design. The beggars were little to be feared without
      Ravenshaw; they would drink themselves stupid,
      and on the morrow, while they were snoring or bousing,
      the unconscious maid could be carried to the
      ship. As for Ravenshaw, once the drug overcame
      him he would be virtually out of the world for two
      days, at least. He could be locked in a chamber,
      and the beggars informed by Meg that he was gone.
      They would doubtless take themselves off when they
      had drunk the place dry. Meg would await with
      interest the termination of the captain's sleep. Thus
      all would pass without bloodshed and without any
      scandal reaching the bishop's ears too soon. Meanwhile,
      the slightest movement against Ravenshaw,
      or toward Millicent's room, was to be avoided; it
      would only stir the captain to action opposed to the
      effects of the drug. He was still striving against
      those effects, pacing with rapid steps the small
      stretch of floor he allowed himself, and thrusting in
      the air with his weapons.</p>
    <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_331" id="Page_331">[331]</a></span></p>
    <p>He was continually losing his mental grasp and
      regaining it with effort. He wondered how they had
      contrived to drug his wine alone; doubtless the
      woman had the arts of a witch; a woman who talked
      so little was not natural.</p>
    <p>How if, in spite of all his resolution, the drug
      should prove too potent for him? What of the maid
      then? He shuddered to think of her at the mercy
      of Jerningham, who had doubtless provided all means
      of dealing with her in safety from consequences.
      Should he, Ravenshaw, consign her to the protection
      of the beggars? Without his masterful and resourceful
      presence, they were like to prove fickle
      rogues. Should he remove Jerningham forthwith by
      killing him? If he did so, and then succumbed to
      the drug or to Jerningham's men, how might she
      fare at the hands of the survivors, rascals on both
      sides? This friend of Jerningham's was the only
      gentleman in the house, and he was without doubt a
      bird of Jerningham's feather. Where had the captain
      met him before? Ravenshaw, calling up anew
      his energies, stopped in his walk to stare at the
      man, and lurched toward him drunkenly. Suddenly
      the captain's face cleared, he stumbled back to the
      doorway, and cried:</p>
    <p>"Mistress, look, look!"</p>
    <p>So sudden and imperative a cry brought Millicent
      to the threshold, startled, white of face.</p>
    <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_332" id="Page_332">[332]</a></span></p>
    <p>"Look!" went on Ravenshaw. "'Tis he&#8212;that
      night in the street&#8212;in February&#8212;they would not
      let you go&#8212;but I compelled them! And one gave
      me the slip&#8212;a man with a Spanish hat&#8212;a thick-bearded&#8212;Ah!
      'twas you, you, you!" He had
      turned his gaze upon Jerningham. "That was the
      beginning, I trow! Ah, mistress, who were your
      enemies that night, and who was your friend?"</p>
    <p>She stood bereft of speech, her hand against the
      door-post, recognising Sir Clement indeed, and dismayed
      at the frown&#8212;which to suddenly enlightened
      eyes was a betrayal of the truth&#8212;on Jerningham's
      face. And then she wondered at the wild, drunken
      movements of Ravenshaw, who had resumed his
      rapid pacing of the floor in a fresh struggle with the
      persistent opiate.</p>
    <p>"The man will never sleep," said Ermsby, in a low
      tone, to Jerningham. "He will outwalk your medicine.
      You are not like to have him in a worse state
      than he is in now. Let me put an end to him while
      he is thus."</p>
    <p>"But Meg&#8212;" objected Jerningham.</p>
    <p>"If I give him a thrust in my own quarrel, she
      cannot blame you. Come; my weapons are itching."</p>
    <p>"Why do you wish to slay him?"</p>
    <p>"For the sport of it, i' faith." Sir Clement's face
      lighted up with cruelty. "'Tis your only sure way.
      He'll walk out of this cloud presently."</p>
    <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_333" id="Page_333">[333]</a></span></p>
    <p>"As you will," said Jerningham, abruptly, after
      a moment's thought. "But 'tis between you and
      him."</p>
    <p>Sir Clement, without moving, said aloud to the
      captain:</p>
    <p>"I remember our meeting. You boasted you
      could be my teacher with the rapier. I knew not
      then you were Ravenshaw, the roaring captain; else
      I had not put off the lesson."</p>
    <p>"Lesson&#8212;put off lesson&#8212;what lesson?" murmured
      the captain, dreamily, swaying and plunging
      as he strode.</p>
    <p>"I said a time might come when I should see your
      skill," Ermsby went on. "I am bound on a far
      journey to-morrow, and may never meet you again."
      He drew his rapier and dagger, and stepped forward.
      "Come, knave! Remember your insolence that
      night; for I shall make you swallow it!"</p>
    <p>However vague an impression the previous words
      had made on the captain's mind, the sight of sword
      and dagger in threatening position roused and
      steadied him. Not fully sensible of how he had
      come to be opposed by these weapons at this stage,
      he met them with the promptitude of habit. The
      steel of his dagger clashed against the other's sword-point;
      his own rapier shot forth to be narrowly
      diverted in like manner. There was exchange of
      thrust and parry till the place sang with the ring of<span class="pagenum"><a
          id="Page_334" name="Page_334">[334]</a></span>
      steel. The jocund heat of battle woke in the captain's
      blood, its fierce thrill gladdened his soul and
      invigorated his body. And yet he went as one in a
      dream, with the lurches of a drunken man. But
      dazed as he appeared in countenance, wild and
      uncontrolled as his movements looked, his eye was
      never false as to the swift dartings of his enemy's
      weapons, his hand never failed to meet steel with
      steel. Some spirit within him, offspring of nature
      and practice conjoined, seemed to clear his eye and
      guide his arm, however his body plunged or his legs
      went awry.</p>
    <p>Meg ran in from the kitchen at the first sound of
      steel. Jerningham hastened back and drew her out
      of the way of the fighters, saying:</p>
    <p>"They fell a-quarrelling; I could not part them.
      See what effect the potion hath upon him; he should
      sleep now, but for this fighting. I hope 'twill end
      without blood."</p>
    <p>The beggars, now drunk, were looking over one
      another's heads from the kitchen, not daring to
      enter without the order; and Jerningham's men,
      drawn from their dice by the noise, were crowded
      together beyond the left-hand doorway. Jerningham
      hoped that Ravenshaw would yet, in a moment of
      exhaustion, yield to the opiate ere Sir Clement found
      opportunity for a home thrust. So he stood with
      Meg at the fireplace, while Millicent, held by the<span class="pagenum"><a
          id="Page_335" name="Page_335">[335]</a></span>
      interest and import of the scene, watched from
      her threshold. The fighters tramped up and down
      the hall.</p>
    <p>"Never with that thrust, good teacher!" said
      Ermsby, blocking a peculiar deviation of his opponent's
      blade from its apparent mark&#8212;his right
      groin&#8212;toward his left breast.</p>
    <p>"Nor you with that feint, boy!" retorted the
      captain, ignoring a half-thrust, and catching on his
      dagger the lightning-swift lunge that followed.</p>
    <p>Furiously they gave and took, panting, dripping
      with sweat, their faces red and tense, their blazing
      eyes fixed. Now the captain threw himself forward
      when there seemed an opening in the other's guard;
      now he sprang back before a similar onslaught on
      his adversary's part. He swayed and staggered, and
      sometimes appeared to stop himself in the nick of
      time from falling headlong, but always his attack and
      guard were as true as those of Sir Clement, whose
      body and limbs moved as by springs of steel. It
      seemed as if neither's point could ever reach flesh,
      so sure and swift was the defence; the pair might
      have been clad in steel.</p>
    <p>Ravenshaw had worked back to the front of the
      hall; suddenly he sprang forward, driving Sir Clement
      toward the fireplace. Ermsby made the usual
      feint, the usual swift-following lunge. Ravenshaw
      caught it, but with a sharp turn of the wrist that<span class="pagenum"><a
          id="Page_336" name="Page_336">[336]</a></span>
      loosened his grip so that his dagger was struck from
      his hand by the deflected sword-point. Sir Clement
      uttered a shout of triumph, and thereby put himself
      back in the game by the hundredth part of a second;
      in that infinitesimal time the captain drove his old
      thrust home. Sir Clement dropped, limp and heavy,
      his cry of victory scarce having ceased to resound.</p>
    <p>Ravenshaw turned fiercely about, his sword ready
      for new foes. Startled at the movement, Jerningham
      called his men to seize the slayer. The captain
      shouted to the beggars. These came staggering in
      from the kitchen, but he saw they were helpless with
      drink. The white-bearded fellow was feebly brandishing
      a pistol which he had made ready for firing,&#8212;the
      weapon he had pointed at Ravenshaw in the
      road. The captain seized it, turned toward Jerningham's
      advancing adherents, and fired into the band.
      A man fell with a groan, but his comrades passed
      over him, and Millicent recognised, as his false beard
      became displaced in his struggles, the fellow who
      had denounced Ravenshaw in her father's garden.
      The captain hurled himself upon the other men;
      brought down Cutting Tom with the sting of his
      rapier; felled Goodcole with a blow of the pistol;
      dashed through the opening he had thus made in
      their ranks; pitched forward as if at last all sense
      had left him; spun around, and grasped at the air
      like one drowning, and fell heavily against the front<span class="pagenum"><a
          id="Page_337" name="Page_337">[337]</a></span>
      door, closing it with his weight. He stood leaning,
      his head hanging forward, his arms and jaw falling
      loose.</p>
    <p>"No more, men!" cried Jerningham, though the
      half-dozen appalled survivors needed no command to
      refrain, any more than the beggars, who were stumbling
      over their staves. "The knave hath slain Sir
      Clement Ermsby, but he is done for, too. Now,
      mistress, for a better lodging!"</p>
    <p>The captain, mistily, as if at a great distance, saw
      his enemy clasp the girl's waist. He tried to move,
      but could not even keep his feet save by bracing
      himself against the door. Suddenly, as the maid
      drew away from Jerningham's face of hot desire,
      Ravenshaw was thrown forward by a violent push
      of the door from without. Staggering to the table,
      he turned and looked. In stepped the old cripple,
      soaking wet; behind him was a portly, fat-faced gentleman,
      followed by several rustic varlets armed with
      pikes and broadswords. Lights flared in the porch,
      and with the sound of the rain came that of snorting,
      pawing horses.</p>
    <p>"Well met, Master Etheridge," spoke Ravenshaw,
      thickly. "Look to your niece."</p>
    <p>Jerningham stared in chagrin; Millicent ran with
      a cry of joy to her Uncle Bartlemy. Then the
      captain said, "Thank God, I may now go asleep!"
      and fell full length upon the floor.</p>

    <h2><a id="CHAPTER_XX" name="CHAPTER_XX">CHAPTER XX.</a></h2>
    <p>HOLYDAY'S FURTHER ADVENTURES.</p>
    <p>
      "O, when will this same year of night have end?"<br />
      <br />
      &#8212;<i>The Two Angry Women of Abington.</i><br />
    </p>
    <p>Master Holyday at first thought himself lucky
      to be left alive, though naked to his shirt and bound
      to a tree by hempen cords which were tied around
      his wrists behind him, and around his ankles. But
      he soon began to doubt the pleasures of existence,
      and the possibility of its long continuance, in his
      situation. There was a smarting pain between his
      eyes, his face felt swollen all around those organs,
      his arms ached from their enforced position, the chill
      of the night assailed his naked skin.</p>
    <p>He bemoaned the inconveniences of a stationary
      condition, and for the first time in his life realised
      what it was to be a tree, rooted to one spot all its
      days. He no longer deemed it a happy fate that the
      gods bestowed on the old couple as a reward for
      their hospitality, in the Metamorphoses,&#8212;that of
      being turned, at their death, into oaks. And he
      became swiftly of opinion that the damsel who
      escaped the pursuit of Apollo by transforming herself<span class="pagenum"><a
          id="Page_339" name="Page_339">[339]</a></span>
      into a laurel would have been wiser to endure the
      god's embraces. And yet, as an accession of dampness&#8212;mist,
      if one could have seen it in the blackness
      of the forest&#8212;set his bare legs trembling and
      shrinking, he envied the trees their bark; and as
      each arm felt its cramped state the more intolerably,
      he coveted their freedom of waving their limbs about
      in the wind. At this, he strained petulantly to move
      his wrists apart, and, to his amazement, the cord
      yielded a little. He exerted his muscles again, and
      the hemp eased yet more. A few further efforts
      enabled him to slip free his hands. In their haste
      his two despoilers had made their knots carelessly.
      They had been more thorough in fastening his
      ankles. But, bending his knees, and lowering his
      body, he set to work with his fingers, and after many
      a scrape of his skin against the bark, many a protest
      of discomfort on the part of his strained legs, he set
      himself at liberty. Surprised at having been capable
      of so much, he stepped forward with the joy of regained
      freedom, but struck his toe against a fallen
      bough, and went headlong into a brake of brambles.</p>
    <p>Cursing the darkness, and his fate, with every one
      of the hundred scratches that gave him anguish of
      limb and body, he backed out of the thicket, and
      moved cautiously in the opposite direction, holding
      his hands before him, and feeling the earth with his
      toes before setting foot in a new place.</p>
    <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_340" id="Page_340">[340]</a></span></p>
    <p>"This is what it is to be a blind man," quoth he.
      Often, despite his precautions, he hurt his feet with
      roots and sticks, and cut them upon sharp-edged
      stones. He began to think he was doomed to a
      perpetual labour of wandering through a pitch-dark
      forest; it seemed so long since he had known peace
      of body and mind that he fancied he should never
      again be restored to the knowledge. He knew not,
      in the darkness, which way he was going; he moved
      on mainly from a disinclination to remain in one
      place, lest he should experience again the feelings
      of a rooted plant.</p>
    <p>He began to speculate upon his chances of falling
      in with dangerous beasts, and upon the probable
      outcome of such an encounter. He had known
      of a man upon whom a threatened buck had once
      wrought the vengeance so vastly overdue from its
      race to mankind; in his poaching expeditions with
      Sir Nicholas the vicar he had often shuddered with a
      transient fear of a similar fate. In those expeditions
      he had always had company, had been armed and
      clad; the strange sense of helplessness that besets
      an undressed man was a new feeling to him.</p>
    <p>At last, to his temporary relief, he came out of
      the wood, as he knew by the less degree of darkness,
      the change of air, and the smooth turf which
      was delicious to his torn feet. But presently the
      turf became spongy; water oozed out as it gave<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_341"
          name="Page_341">[341]</a></span>
      beneath his feet. He turned to the left, thinking
      to avoid the marsh without entering the wood
      again; but the ground became still softer; a few
      more steps brought him into sedgy pools several
      inches deep.</p>
    <p>"This is worse than the wood," he groaned, and
      put his face in what he took to be the direction of
      the trees. But the farther he went, the deeper he
      sank in water. He now knew not which way to
      go in order to find the wood, or even the comparatively
      solid turf on which he had formerly been. So
      he stood, railing inwardly against the spiteful destiny
      that had selected him for the butt of its mirth.
      He had a sensation of being drawn downward; he
      remembered, with horror, the stories of people sucked
      under by the marshes, and he lifted first one foot
      and then the other. He kept up this alternate
      motion, trying each time to set his foot in a fresh
      place, and yet fearing to move backward or forward
      lest he find himself worse off. The dread of becoming
      a fixture in the earth came over him again, as a
      greater probability than before, and impelled him to
      move his legs faster.</p>
    <p>"Would I were a morris-dancer now, with practice
      of this motion," he thought, as the muscles of his
      legs became more and more weary; and he marvelled
      understandingly at Will Kempe's famous dance to
      pipe and tabor from London to Norwich. "Better,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_342"
          name="Page_342">[342]</a></span>
      after all, to be a tree," he sighed, "and not have to
      toil thus all night lest the earth swallow me."</p>
    <p>His legs finally rebelling against this monotonous
      exercise, he resolved to go forward whatever befall;
      and just at that moment he saw, at what distance he
      could not determine, a faint light. He uttered a cry
      of satisfaction, supposing it to be a cottage window, or
      a lantern borne by some night-walking countryman.
      As it moved not at his cry, he decided it was a cottage
      window, and he hastened toward it, through the
      tall grass, careless how far he sank into the marsh.
      But, as he drew near, it started away from him; then
      he told himself it was a lantern, and he called out to its
      bearer not to be afraid, as he was but a poor scholar
      lost in the fen. The light fled all the faster. As
      he increased his pace, so did it. At last, out of
      breath, he stopped in despair. The lantern stopped,
      also. He started again; it started, too.</p>
    <p>"Oh, churl, boor, clodpate, whatever thou art!"
      he shouted. "To treat a poor benighted traveller
      thus, that means thee no harm! These are country
      manners, sure enough. Go to the devil, an thou
      wilt. I'll no more follow thee."</p>
    <p>But as the light now came to a stand, he ran
      toward it, thinking the rustic had taken heart. He
      was almost upon it, when suddenly it separated into
      three lights, which leaped in three different directions.
      Knowing not which to follow, he stood be<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_343"
          name="Page_343">[343]</a></span>wildered.
      After a moment, he made for the nearest
      light; it disappeared entirely. He turned to watch
      the others; they had vanished.</p>
    <p>"Oh, this is ridiculous!" he said. "This cannot
      be real. I perceive what it is. It is a dream I am
      having; a foolish, bad dream. It has been a dream
      ever since&#8212;since when? I was writing a puppet
      play, and I must have fallen asleep; I wrought my
      mind into a poetic fever, and therefore my dream is
      so troubled and wild. My courtship of that maid,&#8212;but
      no, that was in bright day, 'tis certain, and 'tis
      never bright day in dreams. Well, when I wake, I
      shall see where I am, and learn where the dream
      began; perchance I am still at that horrible tree.
      No; alas! these aches and scratches, this wretched
      marsh, are too palpable. 'Tis no dream. Would it
      were. Perhaps those rascals killed me in the wood,
      and I am in hell. Well, I will on, then, till I meet
      the devil; he may condescend to discourse with a
      poor scholar; he should have much to tell worth a
      man's hearing; no doubt, if he cannot talk in English,
      he can in Latin. Ah, what? I am again on
      <i>terra firma</i>: but <i>terra incognita</i> still. I'll go on till
      something stops me. Oh!" he ejaculated, as he
      bumped against a tree. "Here is another wood. Or
      is it the same wood? I know not; but I will on."</p>
    <p>A brief uncovering of the moon&#8212;the same which
      revealed to Millicent the huddled roofs of Marshleigh<span class="pagenum"><a
          id="Page_344" name="Page_344">[344]</a></span>
      Grange&#8212;gave Holyday a view of his surroundings.
      Looking back across the fen, he saw what must
      be the wood from which he had come. He stood,
      therefore, on the border of a second wood. He
      knew the wind was from the west; hence, noting
      the direction in which the clouds were flying, he
      perceived that his course had been southward and
      from the river. He ought to be on familiar ground
      now, which he had often scoured with the parson
      and their fellow poachers; but ere he could assure
      himself, moon and earth were blotted out, and he
      was again in a world of the black unknown.</p>
    <p>Turning his back to the marsh, he traversed the
      second wood. A swift, loud wind raced over the
      tree-tops, bringing greater dampness. He came into
      what might be a glade, or a space of heath, which
      he proceeded to cross. As he had been gradually
      ascending in the past few minutes, he had no fear
      of another bog at this place. He was by this time
      ready to drop with fatigue. Stumbling over a little
      mound, he fell upon soft grass. He lay there for
      some minutes, resting, till his body seemed to stiffen
      with cold. Then he rose, and plunged wearily on
      in despair. Suddenly, to the joy of his heart, he
      heard voices ahead.</p>
    <p>"I'll take oath 'tis no deer," said one. "Come
      on; the keeper is abroad in this walk; I tell you
      I spied the candle in's window to light him home."</p>
    <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_345" id="Page_345">[345]</a></span></p>
    <p>"I'll have a shot at it, for all that," said another.</p>
    <p>Poachers, thought Holyday; and they were speaking
      of him. He flung himself down, just in time
      to hear the twang of a crossbow where the voices
      were, and the whizz of a bolt through the air where
      his body had been.</p>
    <p>"'Fore God, thou hast laid the thing low," said a
      third voice. Recognising it, Holyday leaped up with
      a cry, and ran forward, calling out:</p>
    <p>"Sir Nicholas! oh, Sir Nick, thou poaching rascal,
      'tis I!"</p>
    <p>"God save us, 'tis a ghost; a human ghost!"
      cried the first speaker.</p>
    <p>"'Tis a white thing on two legs, sure," answered
      the vicar, with trepidation.</p>
    <p>"'Tis the devil come for you; he spoke your name,"
      said their companion, affrightedly; and instantly came
      the sound of feet running away like mad.</p>
    <p>Holyday pursued, shouting, "'Tis I, Ralph Holyday!"
      But the poachers, hearing the name, and
      thinking it to be the spirit of Holyday come to
      announce his own death, were soon quite out of
      hearing.</p>
    <p>Losing their direction, and knowing his wornout
      legs were no match for their fresher ones, Holyday
      sank to the earth, ready to weep with vexation.</p>
    <p>"I see," he wailed. "'Tis a mockery devised
      to torment me. To lift me out of the mire of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_346"
          name="Page_346">[346]</a></span>
      despair into the very arms of my friend, and then
      to fling me back deeper! A fine joke, no doubt,
      on the part of Heaven; but why one poor scholar
      should provide all the mirth, I do not clearly perceive.
      Was it indeed Sir Nick, or was it but an
      illusion of mine ears? 'Tis all the same. Well,
      I will sit shivering here till daylight; what else
      can I do?"</p>
    <p>But suddenly came the rain, a wind-driven deluge,
      showing its full fury at the outset. In a trice the
      scholar was drenched; the drops seemed to beat
      him down; there was no surcease of them. He
      ran for cover, and presently gained that of another
      part of the wood. But even the trees could not
      keep out this downpour. Water streamed from the
      branches upon his head and body. He was flung
      upon, buffeted, half-drowned. Never had he received
      such a castigation from man or nature. He thought
      the elements were arrayed against him, earth to trip
      and bruise him, air to chill him, fire to delude him,
      water to flog him to death. But on he went, moved
      always by a feeling that any spot must be better
      than that whereon he was. At last he saw another
      light.</p>
    <p>"Nay, nay," said he; "I am not to be fooled so
      again. Go to, Jack-with-the-lantern! I chase no
      more will-o'-the-wisps."</p>
    <p>But he bethought him that such a rain would put out<span class="pagenum"><a
          id="Page_347" name="Page_347">[347]</a></span>
      any false fire; moreover, he was in a wood, on high
      ground. And then, as he approached, the light took
      the form of a candle in a window. He remembered
      what the poacher had said. This must be the keeper's
      lodge; if the candle was still in the window, the
      keeper had not yet come home,&#8212;the rain had caught
      him too. The keeper being still abroad, his door
      might not be fastened. With a sense of having
      reached the limit of endurance of the rain's pelting,&#8212;for
      his thin shirt was no protection,&#8212;he dashed
      blindly for the window, which was on the leeward
      side of the lodge. He felt his way along the front
      of the house to the entrance, pushed the door open,
      and stepped into a low, comfortable apartment, like
      the kitchen and living room of a yeoman's cottage.
      Out of the rain and wind at last, his grateful legs
      bore him across the room to a bench. He sat down,
      nestling back to a great deer-skin that hung against
      the bare wall of wood and plaster.</p>
    <p>At one side of the room was a door to another
      apartment; at the back was a ladder-like set of
      wooden steps leading to a trap-way in the ceiling.
      Holyday had scarce observed these details by the
      candle in the window, when a coarse female voice,
      as of one suddenly roused from sleep, called out from
      the other room: "Is't thou, Jack? Time thou wert
      home!&#8212;hear the rain."</p>
    <p>Holyday kept silence. Then he heard a bed<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_348"
          name="Page_348">[348]</a></span>
      creak as under the movements of a heavy body.
      The woman was coming out to see what had made
      the noise. And he, clad only in the briefest of
      shirts! A double terror shook him; he sprang
      across the room and blew out the candle. The door
      opened, and a heavy, unshod tread sounded upon the
      floor.</p>
    <p>"Ecod, the light's out!" said the woman. "And
      the door open." She found her way in the dark to
      the door which Holyday had neglected to close upon
      entering. "'Twas the wind, I wis. Fool Jack, to
      leave the door ill-fastened! Well, he is served right,
      for the wind hath blown out his candle. I must
      make another light, forsooth."</p>
    <p>Holyday, standing perfectly still near the window,
      heard the woman grumbling about the task of striking
      a light. He felt himself blushing terribly in the
      dark; he was surely undone. But with a timely
      inspiration, and glad for once that his feet were bare,
      he went tiptoe back to where he had sat, stepped
      over the bench, and slipped behind the deer-skin,
      flattening himself as much as possible against the
      wall as he stood.</p>
    <p>The woman got the candle aflame, looked around
      the room, replaced the light in the window, and went
      back to the other chamber. Hearing the bed creak
      again as it received her weight, Holyday came out
      from his hiding-place. What should he do in order<span class="pagenum"><a
          id="Page_349" name="Page_349">[349]</a></span>
      to profit for the rest of the night by the comforts
      of this abode without discovery? He knew who
      this woman was, and who Jack, her husband, was.
      He had fallen foul of this keeper before he had left
      for London, and the keeper was a fellow who would
      take revenge when occasion offered. Pondering on
      the situation, Holyday was almost of a mind to
      face the stormy night again rather than risk capture
      by the man in such circumstances. Before he could
      make up his mind, he heard a gruff voice outside
      ordering a dog to its kennel. It was Jack's voice.
      Master Holyday fled panic-stricken up the narrow
      stairs, through the open trap-door.</p>
    <p>He was in a place of darkness. He forgot that
      the height of the cottage&#8212;which served but to
      house an under-keeper and his wife, and was not the
      principal lodge pertaining to this chase&#8212;forbade
      that the upper story should be more than a mere
      loft; but of this he was speedily reminded by a bump
      of his head against a rafter. The loft was warm and
      probably unoccupied, for Jack rarely had a guest.
      The rain upon the roof made a din in Holyday's ears.
      He felt his way to one end of the place, and lay
      down, near a small window. He heard Jack entering
      below, swearing at the storm, fastening the door,
      and finally joining his spouse in the sleeping-chamber.
      There was some conversation in low tones,
      and then the house was still.</p>
    <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_350" id="Page_350">[350]</a></span></p>
    <p>Holyday's foot struck against the end of a wooden
      chest. Crawling to it, he opened the top, and found
      what he had hoped for,&#8212;soft garments in which
      to lie. He tore off his wet shirt, rolled himself up in
      what seemed to be a woman's gown,&#8212;Jack's wife
      required dresses of ample capacity,&#8212;and sank away
      in sweetest comfort to oblivion.</p>
    <p>He woke from a dream of delicious warmth and
      wondrous light, and found the sunshine in his face.
      His window was toward the south. The sun had
      passed the line of noon. Holyday gathered himself
      up; surveyed the garment of russet wool he had
      slept in; and finally dressed himself in it in proper
      manner. It hung loose upon him, but it covered his
      nakedness.</p>
    <p>A creak of the stairway drew his eyes toward the
      trap. There rose into view the frowsy head and fat
      face of Jack's wife.</p>
    <p>"Ecod, I knew I heard somebody!" she cried,
      staring at Holyday fiercely. "And dressed in my
      clothes, too! Oh, thou thief, I'll tear thy skin from
      thee!"</p>
    <p>She came up the steps as fast as her bulk allowed.
      But Master Holyday, with one glance at her great
      clenched fists, kicked open the casement behind him,
      fell upon all fours, and backed out of the window,
      from which he dropped as the woman reached it.
      He alighted on a bank of flowers, scrambled to his<span class="pagenum"><a
          id="Page_351" name="Page_351">[351]</a></span>
      feet, and, holding his skirt above his knees, trusted
      all to his bare legs. He heard the woman's furious
      threats from the window, but tarried not to answer.
      Plunging through the forest with the new strength
      derived from his long sleep, he was soon far from the
      cottage. Easing into a walk, he crossed heath and
      fields till he came in sight of a pleasant mansion on
      a green hill. Between him and the hill lay a road,
      which he must needs cross to reach Sir Nicholas's
      house. He gained this road, and, seeing nobody
      about, walked along it some distance so as to skirt
      the base of the hill. Unexpectedly, from a lane he
      was passing, came a resonant voice:</p>
    <p>"Well, God-'a'-mercy! what transformation have
      we here?"</p>
    <p>Holyday turned, and beheld Captain Ravenshaw.</p>
    <hr class="chap" />
    <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_352" id="Page_352">[352]</a></span></p>
    <h2><a id="CHAPTER_XXI" name="CHAPTER_XXI">CHAPTER XXI.</a></h2>
    <p>THE CAPTAIN FORSWEARS SWAGGERING.</p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>"My follies and my fancies have an end here."&#8212;<i>Wit without Money.</i></p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>When Ravenshaw came to his senses, after losing
      them on the floor of the hall, he gazed around in
      wonder. He was in a soft bed, in a handsome room
      which he had never seen before. Bright sunlight
      streamed through an open casement which let in
      also the music of birds. Beside his bed lay his
      clothes, neatly arranged; his sword and dagger;
      and Master Holyday's puppet-play, which he had
      carried in his doublet. At sight of the manuscript,
      full remembrance rushed upon his mind. Though
      his bodily craving was to sink back on his pillow,
      and a fierce ache was in his head, he leaped out of
      bed. There was too much to be learned and done.</p>
    <p>He pounced upon the ewer and basin he saw at
      hand, and speedily soused himself into a more live
      and less fevered state. While putting on his clothes,
      wondering where on earth he was, he looked out
      of the window upon a sweet prospect of green
      hills, fields, a few distant sun-touched roofs, and a<span class="pagenum"><a
          id="Page_353" name="Page_353">[353]</a></span>
      far-off steeple among trees. It was plain that he
      looked from a house on a low hill, and that noontime
      had arrived.</p>
    <p>A door opened, and in was thrust the head of a
      man whose blue coat betokened a servant, and whose
      manner declared a rustic.</p>
    <p>"Dod, then your worship be up!" said this fellow,
      awkwardly entering. "Young mistress did vow she
      heard somewhat stirring. I ask your worship's pardon.
      If your worship had called&#8212;" He set about
      trussing the points of the captain's doublet and hose.</p>
    <p>"Who art thou?" asked Ravenshaw.</p>
    <p>"Your servant, sir. To tell truth, sir, Master
      Etheridge's servant, sir; but yours while you be
      here, your worship."</p>
    <p>"Master Etheridge? Master Bartlemy Etheridge,
      meanest thou?"</p>
    <p>"Yes, sir, by your leave, sir. He bade me attend
      in the gallery here, sir, to serve your worship an you
      called."</p>
    <p>"This is his house, then?"</p>
    <p>"Yes, sir; his country-seat, your worship,&#8212;not
      that he hath any town house, begging your pardon."</p>
    <p>"How came I here?"</p>
    <p>"Dod, upon a stable door we found loose at
      Marshleigh Grange last night. I'fecks, I'll never forget
      such rain; and to be roused out of bed in the
      black o' the night, too! But as to fetching your<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_354"
          name="Page_354">[354]</a></span>
      worship hither, the young mistress wouldn't come if
      you were left; so master must needs bid us seek
      somewhat to bear you hither upon. And never once
      you woke, e'en when me and Dick took off your
      clothes and put you to bed."</p>
    <p>A strange warmth glowed in the captain's soul.
      Lost in his thoughts, he passed out to the gallery
      as soon as he was dressed. It was a wide, airy
      gallery, with doors along the sides, and a window at
      each end. In one of the windows sat a figure, which
      rose the instant he appeared. It was Millicent. For
      a second he paused, fearing she would meet him with
      her old scorn, or flee down the stairs. But she stood
      motionless, returning his look with some timidity,
      blushing and pensive.</p>
    <p>"So," said he, quietly, "you would not come if
      I were left."</p>
    <p>"I was much your debtor," she faltered.</p>
    <p>"And you, watching here, heard me stirring, and
      sent the manservant?"</p>
    <p>"Why, I was watching here," she replied, confusedly,
      "lest my father should come unawares.
      We were seen and followed, Master Holyday and
      I, and my uncle thinks my father would go first to
      Master Holyday's house, and then come hither.
      But let him come what way he will, I can see him
      afar from this window."</p>
    <p>"And how if you see him?"</p>
    <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_355" id="Page_355">[355]</a></span></p>
    <p>"There is an old chest in my aunt's chamber that
      my uncle hath made ready, with holes bored in it for
      air. They will lock me in, and feign that the key is
      lost, and that the chest hath not been opened this
      year."</p>
    <p>"Your uncle hath stood your friend indeed in
      this."</p>
    <p>"Yes, he and&#8212;others,&#8212;more than I deserve.
      My uncle is no coward, in truth,&#8212;save to his wife,
      and when he is in London against her will and
      knowledge." She smiled faintly.</p>
    <p>"He must have shown courage enough to Master
      Jerningham to fetch you off safe&#8212;and me, too,
      when I was o'erthrown at last by their drug."</p>
    <p>"Why, of a truth, my uncle came to that place
      with so many men&#8212;every Jack on the estate, and
      all that could be roused quickly in the village&#8212;that
      Master Jerningham would have done ill to contest.
      The heart was taken out of him, I think; four of his
      men were killed, and of the rest, those that had come
      with me fled when they saw their leader slain."</p>
    <p>"Four men killed, troth!" said Ravenshaw, "of
      whom I shall be asked to give account."</p>
    <p>"But you will not be asked," she replied, quickly.
      "'Twas in self-defence&#8212;and in defence of me. But
      there will be no question made of the affair. Master
      Jerningham seemed as much to desire that as&#8212;as
      my uncle. He hath his own reasons; he said he<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_356"
          name="Page_356">[356]</a></span>
      and his men would keep silence. So my uncle
      agreed to say nothing; those drunken beggars and
      the rascals that betrayed me will hold their tongues
      for their own sake; and Master Jerningham said he
      would dispose of the slain."</p>
    <p>"But the slain have friends,&#8212;that gentleman will
      surely be inquired after."</p>
    <p>"Master Jerningham said he could explain his
      disappearance, and the other men's. I know not
      how, but I would warrant he spoke in good faith."</p>
    <p>"More false dealing, belike. I'll go and see."</p>
    <p>"Nay! whither would you go?" Her face showed
      alarm.</p>
    <p>"Back to that house. I must see how matters
      stand there. I must seek out the knaves that
      betrayed you, and learn what hath befallen Master
      Holyday. Where did they leave him?"</p>
    <p>"Alas! I know not where 'twas. They beat him
      down in the wood, and left him,&#8212;tied to a tree, one
      said; and they robbed him of his clothes. I should
      not know where to look for the place."</p>
    <p>"Be of good cheer. I'll find him, though I search
      the forest through; and, if he be alive, I'll not eat
      or sleep till you are wed."</p>
    <p>"Then 'twas indeed your planning?" she queried,
      looking not too well pleased. "I had begun to think
      as much, after last night."</p>
    <p>"Why, troth, I&#8212;ah&#8212;did give the plan my<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_357"
          name="Page_357">[357]</a></span>
      countenance," admitted the captain. "But we durst
      not let you know I was privy to it; you thought so
      ill of me&#8212;and rightly. But the bringing you to
      Marshleigh Grange was pure treason against us.
      I was too trustful; but I will undo my error if
      Holyday be alive."</p>
    <p>"I marvel why you should have plotted so for
      me."</p>
    <p>"To save you from wedding Sir Peregrine Medway;
      and to put you out of Master Jerningham's
      ken, as well. You said any husband was better&#8212;"</p>
    <p>"But why chose you Master Holyday?"</p>
    <p>"Faith, is he not young, and a gentleman, and
      comely? And he will be well provided for upon his
      marriage, e'en though he bring a wife without dowry.
      And then I was pleased at the chance of benefiting
      him, too. I could think of no better remedy than a
      husband, and no better husband than he."</p>
    <p>Millicent was silent a moment, her brows a little
      bent as if she would say something she knew not
      how to say; then seeing him move, as if to depart,
      she resumed:</p>
    <p>"You spoke of Master Jerningham as well as Sir
      Peregrine."</p>
    <p>"Yes; I knew of his intent toward you. What
      I said last night was true. He employed me to&#8212;what
      will you think of me?"</p>
    <p>"But you did not," she said, holding his glance.</p>
    <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_358" id="Page_358">[358]</a></span></p>
    <p>"No," he answered, in a low voice.</p>
    <p>"Why did you not?"</p>
    <p>"Faith, I cannot tell&#8212;I was formerly a gentleman&#8212;and
      you were&#8212;troth, when I talked with
      you in the garden, I could not. And when I came
      again, though I kept my false name, knowing how
      people held my true one, 'twas indeed to plan your
      escape from that old knight."</p>
    <p>"I know not how I can ever prove my gratitude,&#8212;and
      for last night." She paused, and dropped her
      eyes; her heart beat fast while she awaited his
      answer.</p>
    <p>"You have put the debt on my side," he said.
      "You would not come from that place if I were
      left. And but now you were attentive to my
      waking."</p>
    <p>Evidently the answer fell short of her hopes.</p>
    <p>"Oh," she said, a little pettishly, "I am on the
      watch here lest my father come, as I told you. As
      for your waking, yonder clodpate is a stupid fool.
      My uncle thought, being drugged, you might sleep
      all day and longer; but I said you were no ordinary
      man."</p>
    <p>"Troth," said Ravenshaw, smiling, "I somewhat
      broke the drug's power by resisting till your uncle
      came. And now that I am so soon awake, the
      sooner may I seek your husband that shall be." He
      turned toward the stair-head.</p>
    <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_359" id="Page_359">[359]</a></span></p>
    <p>"But hear me, I pray! If you go back there, you
      hazard your life again."</p>
    <p>He touched his sword and dagger, which he had
      girded on in the bedchamber. "I still carry these,"
      quoth he; "and I must thank you for recovering
      them."</p>
    <p>"Nay," said she, blushing again; "the sword never
      left your hand. There was but your dagger to seek.
      But go not back there, I beg of you!" She could
      scarce conceal the depth of her solicitude.</p>
    <p>"Why, why, mistress, fear not for me. There is
      no danger."</p>
    <p>"I entreat you not to go."</p>
    <p>"Nay, the more you concern yourself for my
      safety, the more am I bound to go and serve you."</p>
    <p>"Take men with you, then."</p>
    <p>"Nay, your uncle must keep his men here to
      protect you. But one to show me the way,&#8212;the
      old beggar that summoned your uncle last night,&#8212;perchance
      he came hither with us."</p>
    <p>"No, he stayed with his comrades; my uncle paid
      him for his service."</p>
    <p>"I must e'en thank your uncle for that; and for
      his care of me."</p>
    <p>"I will take you to him, and my aunt," she replied,
      eagerly, seeing a chance of delaying his departure
      and gaining time for dissuasions.</p>
    <p>But he seemed to read her thought; he took a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_360"
          name="Page_360">[360]</a></span>
      sudden resolution, and said: "Nay, I'll thank him
      when I return. Farewell, and&#8212;"</p>
    <p>"You will return&#8212;soon?" she said, with quivering
      lip.</p>
    <p>"Ay, with Master Holyday&#8212;or news of him,"
      he answered, and turned to the servant: "Show
      me the way to Marshleigh Grange, and make haste."</p>
    <p>Avoiding her glance, he hurried down the stairs
      ere she could frame a further objection. The servant,
      wonder-eyed, followed him. When he was out
      of the house, he shook his head, and said within
      himself: "Another minute in her presence, and
      'twould have been she that bade me go, I that
      begged to stay."</p>
    <p>He dared not look back; had he done so, as he
      hastened down the hillside, he might have seen that
      she had changed her window for one which looked
      toward his road. When he disappeared in the lane
      to which his man conducted him, she dropped her
      face upon her arms.</p>
    <p>The lonely plain whereon the Grange stood was
      nearer than he had supposed. When he reached the
      house, there was no sign of life about it. He called
      and knocked; and finally was admitted to the hall
      by Jeremy. The old man was its only occupant,
      living or dead. He was engaged in washing out
      sundry stains that reddened the floor.</p>
    <p>"Hath your master taken them away?" asked<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_361"
          name="Page_361">[361]</a></span>
      Ravenshaw, bluntly, nodding toward the stained
      places.</p>
    <p>"Ay, but a short while since," said the old man,
      unconcernedly. "I trow they are to have sea burial.
      He came and had them carried aboard a ship. He
      and they are e'en now bound seaward."</p>
    <p>"That is strange. Where is the woman, Mistress
      Meg?"</p>
    <p>"He hath ta'en her along on the ship. Troth,
      she swore she would not stay another night under
      this roof. There was much talk atwixt 'em. She
      is to be a queen on an island where 'tis always
      summer."</p>
    <p>Wondering if the old man had lost his wits, the
      captain asked, "And you are alone here?"</p>
    <p>"Ay, and well enough, too. I have no mind to
      go a-voyaging. I shall have all the milk, now, and
      all the eggs; and no foolish woman prating ever
      of ghosts and witches. I'll have some peace and
      quiet now."</p>
    <p>"The beggars have gone, then?"</p>
    <p>"Ay; when they came sober, and saw slain men
      upon the floor, they fled as if the hangman were
      after 'em. Ha! I knew enough to hide the chickens
      over night." The old man chuckled triumphantly.</p>
    <p>From what further information he could draw,
      the captain made out that Jerningham's own men
      had embarked with him, and that Cutting Tom's<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_362"
          name="Page_362">[362]</a></span>
      followers had gone their way unheeded. Not till
      days afterward was he assured that Jerningham
      had indeed set sail for some far country. To the
      bishop and others, the voyager had accounted for
      the absence of Ermsby and Gregory by a tale of
      their having preceded the vessel to Gravesend,
      where they were to come aboard. He and his ship
      were never heard of again.</p>
    <p>The captain left the Grange, thinking next to
      inquire of Sir Nicholas the vicar. If Holyday had
      not contrived to find his way to his old friend's
      abode, the parson would doubtless help search the
      woods for him. Ravenshaw's attendant knew where
      Sir Nicholas lived. The way passed near his master's
      house. The captain made him lead at a rapid
      pace. It was when they were emerging from a lane
      into the road that Ravenshaw came upon Master
      Holyday, attired in the loose-hanging garb of the
      keeper's wife.</p>
    <p>The captain, after the briefest salutations, grasped
      the scholar's arm, and ran with him up the hill
      toward Master Etheridge's house. Millicent, seeing
      them coming, and recognising only Ravenshaw, made
      haste to join her aunt and uncle, who had gone to
      discuss her situation out of her presence. She found
      them in the orchard at the rear of the house.</p>
    <p>To that place, having inquired of the first servant
      he met, the captain dragged the breathless and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_363"
          name="Page_363">[363]</a></span>
      protesting scholar. Millicent's wonder, at sight of
      Holyday's distressed face, was almost equal to that
      of her portly uncle and his stately, angular spouse.</p>
    <p>"Good-morrow, madam," said Ravenshaw, with a
      bow which at once surprised the dame's severity into
      fluttering graciousness. "And to you, sir." He
      then turned to Millicent. "Know you not Master
      Holyday, mistress? I met him by chance; he was
      hastening hither for news of you."</p>
    <p>But Millicent's astonishment at the poor scholar's
      appearance had given place to a look of decided
      disapproval. Holyday himself stood red-faced and
      sullen.</p>
    <p>"You are welcome, sir," said Master Bartlemy
      Etheridge, in an uneasy voice. His countenance
      was worked into a painful attempt to convey something
      to the captain's mind privately; in his concern
      upon that score, he paid no heed to Master Holyday,
      whom his wife greeted with a curtsey.</p>
    <p>"I am much bounden to you, sir," said Ravenshaw.
      "For your care of me, and your hospitality,
      my gratitude shall balance my want of desert. At
      our last meeting&#8212;"</p>
    <p>"Meeting, sir?" broke in Uncle Bartlemy, in
      despair at the evident failure of his facial exertions.
      "I'll take oath I never met you before; it must have
      been some other gentleman of my appearance."</p>
    <p>"Our meeting last night, sir, I meant," said Raven<span class="pagenum"><a
          id="Page_364" name="Page_364">[364]</a></span>shaw,
      with a smile; "though, indeed, 'twas a brief
      matter on my part."</p>
    <p>"Oh, last night, forsooth; oh, yes, yes, yes," said
      the old gentleman, with a look of infinite relief.
      "Troth, yes, certainly, indeed. And you, Master
      Holyday, God save you. 'Tis long since I have seen
      you; you have changed much."</p>
    <p>As Uncle Bartlemy's gaze was upon the scholar's
      dress, Holyday's assumption was that the remark
      was concerned therewith.</p>
    <p>"Faith, sir," said he, resentfully, "'tis fine manners
      in you to jeer; my wearing this gown comes of my
      willingness to marry your niece."</p>
    <p>"Oh, indeed!" quoth Millicent.</p>
    <p>"Troth," went on the poet, miserably, "it hath
      been ill upon ill, e'er since I ran away with her. If
      such a night be the beginning of our marriage,
      what shall be the end of it, in God's name?"</p>
    <p>"There shall be no end of it," retorted Millicent;
      "and no beginning, either. Last night, say you?
      Ay, you showed bravely then. You are well suited
      in a woman's gown, I think. A fine husband you
      would be, to protect a wife!"</p>
    <p>The scholar's face cleared somewhat; turning to
      Ravenshaw, he said:</p>
    <p>"Give me my puppet-play. I'll go back to London.
      You see she will not have me."</p>
    <p>"Softly, softly!" cried the captain. "Would you<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_365"
          name="Page_365">[365]</a></span>
      mar all at the last, mistress? Reflect, I pray; your
      only true safety lies in marriage ere your father finds
      you. You will not bring all my plans to nothing?
      I do entreat you&#8212;"</p>
    <p>He stopped at a sudden parting of her lips; he
      looked around to see what alarmed her. There,
      coming from the house to the orchard, were Master
      Etheridge the goldsmith, Sir Peregrine Medway, and
      a ruddy, irascible-looking country gentleman.</p>
    <p>"Plague take it!" muttered Uncle Bartlemy to
      Millicent; "this comes of not watching."</p>
    <p>As Sir Peregrine was the embodiment of lagging
      weariness, and the goldsmith was himself well fagged,
      their companion was first within speaking distance.
      With scant greeting for the elderly couple, he turned
      fierce eyes on the scholar.</p>
    <p>"How now?" he burst out. "Thou unthrift!
      thou ne'er-do-well! thou good-for-naught! Wouldst
      run away with my old friend's daughter? I'll teach
      thee, knave!"</p>
    <p>But the captain stepped between the elder Holyday
      and the son, for he felt the quarrel to be his
      own, and saw his painfully reared structure of events
      ready to fall about him.</p>
    <p>"Sir," he said, "he did it for your behoof; he
      marries to perpetuate your stock."</p>
    <p>"Sir," replied Holyday the father, "I can attend
      to that myself. I am taking a wife next Thursday;<span class="pagenum"><a
          id="Page_366" name="Page_366">[366]</a></span>
      my rascal son would not seek one when I bade him;
      so I sent him packing; but now he shall come home
      and be kept out of mischief."</p>
    <p>The goldsmith, coming up, ignored his brother,
      bowed stiffly to the latter's wife, and stood before
      Millicent, his hands open as if he would fain clutch
      her.</p>
    <p>"Thou baggage, thou'rt caught in time! Thou
      shalt not sleep till thou'rt tied in marriage to Sir
      Peregrine." He made to grasp her by the arm.</p>
    <p>"Touch me not!" she cried, with a sudden
      thought. "You have no power over me; I am
      married!"</p>
    <p>Her father stared. Master Holyday, taken by
      surprise, said, emphatically:</p>
    <p>"Not to me, that I'll take oath; so I am a free
      man, of a surety!"</p>
    <p>Ravenshaw could have struck him down. But
      Millicent, after one crestfallen moment, said, quietly:</p>
    <p>"Not to Master Holyday, certainly; but to this
      gentleman." And she went to the captain's side.</p>
    <p>There was a moment's general silence, during
      which Sir Peregrine, overcome by his long exertion,
      leaned limply against a tree.</p>
    <p>"To this villain?" cried the goldsmith; "this
      cozener, this notable rascal, this tavern-cheat. 'Tis
      not possible; there hath not been time; not even
      for a license."</p>
    <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_367" id="Page_367">[367]</a></span></p>
    <p>Millicent looked up at Ravenshaw's face, whereby
      he knew she desired him to take up the ruse.</p>
    <p>"Sir," quoth he, "there hath been more time than
      you wot of; we have all been in the plot together
      for three days now."</p>
    <p>"A pack of knaves!" shouted the goldsmith.
      "An there hath been a marriage, 'twill not hold.
      She was bound by pre-contract."</p>
    <p>"'Tis not true," cried Millicent. "Sir Peregrine
      knows I would not receive his tokens."</p>
    <p>"Oh, good lack!" quoth the old knight, faint of
      voice; "'tis all as well. I am glad your daughter
      hath released me, Master Etheridge. She is much
      inclined to jealousy, I see that; belike I should give
      her cause, too. I thank her for my liberty."</p>
    <p>The goldsmith cast on the old knight a look of
      wrathful disgust, and walked precipitately from the
      place, breathing out plagues, murrains, and poxes.
      Sir Peregrine laboriously followed him. But Holyday's
      father dragged the scholar aside to talk with
      him privily.</p>
    <p>Ravenshaw turned to Millicent. "The device
      served well. But the truth must out in time. Your
      father will have his revenge then."</p>
    <p>"Alas, I have told a great falsehood," said she,
      braving her blushes. "I know not how to clear my
      soul of it&#8212;unless you&#8212;" She hesitated.</p>
    <p>"I, mistress? What can I do?"</p>
    <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_368" id="Page_368">[368]</a></span></p>
    <p>"Make it the truth," she faltered, dropping her
      eyes.</p>
    <p>For a time he could not speak.</p>
    <p>"Oh, mistress!" he said, at last, with unsteady
      voice; "would to God I might&#8212;But think you of
      my reputation."</p>
    <p>"You will amend that; 'tis no great matter."</p>
    <p>"I am no worthy mate for you."</p>
    <p>"You have fought for me."</p>
    <p>"You will learn to hate me again; you hated me
      but yesterday."</p>
    <p>"'Twas because I had loved you the day before;
      else I should not have heeded."</p>
    <p>"You are a world too good for me."</p>
    <p>"Troth, I am not good in all eyes. Sir Peregrine
      is glad to be rid of me, and Master Holyday will not
      have me."</p>
    <p>"I am penniless."</p>
    <p>"My uncle hath said he would provide for me."</p>
    <p>Ravenshaw looked at Uncle Bartlemy, who had
      been calming his wife's wonder. The old gentleman,
      with a fine attempt at hidden meaning, thus delivered
      himself:</p>
    <p>"Sir, I owe you much upon the score of our first
      meeting&#8212;whereof you spoke awhile ago. If you
      can be content here in the country, with a wing of
      our poor house, while we live&#8212;'twill all be Millicent's
      when we are buried&#8212;"</p>
    <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_369" id="Page_369">[369]</a></span></p>
    <p>Ravenshaw felt her hand steal into his; he turned
      and took her gently in his arms.</p>
    <p>Master Holyday, having come to an adjustment
      with his father, callously interrupted this embrace
      with the words, "Give me back my puppet-play now,
      and I'll wish you joy, and pardon all my calamities,
      even this dress."</p>
    <p>Ravenshaw drew forth the manuscript from his
      doublet, saying: "If you return to your father's
      house, we are like to be your neighbours. And your
      friend Sir Nicholas shall earn a fee in spite of you."</p>
    <p>"Troth, then, I'll write your nuptial hymn," said
      the poet, tenderly handling his puppet-play. "'Twill
      have a rare sound,&#8212;'Epithalamium to the Beauteous
      Maid of Cheapside and the Roaring Captain.'"</p>
    <p>"Nay, the roaring captain is no more," said Ravenshaw.
      "I am a gentleman again. Believe it,
      sweet."</p>
    <p>"I care not what you are only that you are mine,"
      quoth Millicent.</p>

    <p>An absorbing story of life among a happy and primitive
      people hidden away in far Transylvania, whose peaceful
      life is never disturbed except by the inroads of their turbulent
      neighbors. The opening scenes are laid in Rome;
      and the view of the corrupt, intriguing society there forms
      a picturesque contrast to the scenes of pastoral simplicity
      and savage border warfare that succeed. Mr. Bicknell
      has well performed the difficult task of losing <i>none</i> of the

    <p>This is in many ways the strongest and most interesting
      novel as yet written by this popular author. As the
      title indicates, "My Strangest Case" is a detective
      story, a new departure in the field of literature for Mr.
      Boothby. It has to do with buried treasures stolen from
      the ruined palaces of a forgotten city in China by three
      adventurers, one of whom tricks his partners and escapes
      with the hard-won spoils. From the East the scene
      shifts to London, Paris, and Italy, in the endeavor by
      the hero (the detective) to track the principal adventurer
      and restore to the latter's partners their portion of the
      stolen treasure. The hero proves himself to be a second
      Sherlock Holmes in acumen and sang-froid; and
      the story holds one's interest to the last.</p>

    <p>Few novels of the present day can stand comparison
      with this remarkable book, which must be ranked in
      modern literature dealing with the early Christian era as
      only second to "Ben Hur." Its power, its beauty,
      and above all its deep earnestness of purpose and wonderful
      life and vitality, mark it at once as a masterpiece.
      Mr. Ashton has succeeded in avoiding the faults which
      have been common in practically all the recent novels
      based on the religio-historical theme&#8212;vulgarity and
      sensationalism. "She Stands Alone," while rapid in
      movement and intensely dramatic in plot, is pure and
      noble in every incident. The reader will be charmed by
      its dignity and power, as well as by its dramatic incidents
      and vivid portrayals of those wonderful early
      Christians whose faith and self-sacrifice have been the
      theme of countless writers throughout the ages.</p>

    <p><i>The Boston Transcript says:</i></p>
    <p>"Mr. Hallworth's book is a story of modern New
      York, and of people who have wandered from the dull
      and comfortable plenty of burgher days, when those
      who had not might ask and receive at the hearths of
      great houses. Mr. Hallworth writes of the slum-dwellers
      with a searching, intimate pen, not shrinking
      from the painful chapters, but striving to capture every
      saving glint of humor. The author, who is artist as
      well, has helped out his text with over one hundred
      pen-and-ink sketches, which the publishers have used
      as marginal illustrations, reproducing the manuscript as
      it came from the author, text and sketches line for line.
      A well-known critic, who has already seen the story,
      writes: '"Arline Valére" is in every respect the production
      of an artist. While Dickens is suggested, it is
      not because of any imitation, as the figures in the tale are
      without exception original.'"</p>

    <p>Pauline Bradford Mackie's new novel deals with
      Washington official society in the early sixties. The
      plot is based upon the career (not long since ended) of
      a brilliant and well-known woman, who was at that time
      a power in court circles. The catastrophe which forms
      the turning-point is the wreck of the great lady's ambition,
      which was to make her father President. The
      book will be of interest in the insight it affords into
      history, which is, upon the personal side, as yet unwritten,
      and will please through the charm of its love-story
      between the niece of a member of Lincoln's
      Cabinet and his private secretary.</p>

    <p><i>The Philadelphia North American says:</i></p>
    <p>"A charming and graceful romance, 'Antonia' is in
      some respects an unusual story. Not that it is pretentious;
      rather because it is not so, but fresh and simple
      instead. Here is a story of colonial times which, instead
      of being filled with the mincing archaisms and strutting
      pomposities of the usual historical novel, has caught
      something of the spirit of wide-eyed wonder that held
      men spellbound at the tales of this new world when it
      was indeed new and marvellous&#8212;of the longing for
      freedom that drove them beyond seas and into the savage
      West, there to carve out new realms from the shaggy
      wilderness. 'The Frisians shall be free as long as the
      wind shall blow in the clouds and as long as the world
      shall endure' is the keynote of the story; for its scene is
      New Amsterdam and its characters the sturdy Frisians
      of that colony. The hero is one of the errant adventurers
      from the Lowlands; and the account of his love
      for the wilful Antonia, as difficult and capricious as she is
      charming, and his slow winning of her through the tangle
      of misunderstandings and adventures that beset him, makes
      a story of vivid and unhackneyed interest. In short,
      'Antonia' is romance of the kind that it is a delight to
      find."</p>
